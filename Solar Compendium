## The Solar
**Solars** are known as the most powerful and ancient celestials that exist, a fitting description. Solars are the most powerful force of good that exists in the multiverse and only the greatest of evil entities have dared to approach these divine bastions of powerful light. Even the most powerful fiends fear the might of the godlike solar and only the multitude of demon lords and arch-devils would be audacious enough to meet them in battle without the assistance of any trickery. 

### Birth and existence
When there was nothing except the primordial void, a powerful explosion of light shocked creation. In the center of this powerful explosion was a divine embryo that housed 23 divine entities. These unborn entities were the solars, the first to exist in the young multiverse. They were later followed by the aberrations who claim to be the oldest.

Angels are formed from the astral essence of benevolent gods and are thus divine beings of great power and wisdom. There are only twenty-four solars in existence since it is impossible for deities to create them with their essence given the solar's godlike power and immeasurable strength. 

It is rumored that the lesser angels were created by the gods in the image of the solars but could not fully replicate the power and might of the solars.

It is unknown where solars draw their power from but it is rumored that the solars draw their power from the positive planes.

No entity knows the true origin of the solars. No one knows whether the solars have a creator or are naturally born. Despite the mystery surrounding them, no one is brave enough to confront Xephalam, the first solar. No matter the reason, solars exist to do good and vanquish evils that threaten to upend the balance of the multiverse.

### Pledge of the solar
The solars, unlike the angels modeled after them, are free beings that have no allegiances or masters. Despite their freedom, the solars desired to pledge themselves to other worthy entities that could direct their power into other important matters. The solars are wise creatures that carefully choose whom they wish to give their power to. The solars all collectively have the power of foresight so their pledges sometimes seem eccentric or weird. An example would be when a solar once pledged his power to a young child, under the guise of a human knight. 

### The 24 solars
There are 24 solars that exist in the multiverse. Unlike their weaker angelic copies, solars have free will and are not bound by any beings except themselves, unless they pledge themselves. Out of the 24, eight known solars have pledged themselves to benevolent beings while the other 16 lie in wait or have not yet found a being worthy to pledge their power to. 

### A Solar's powers
The solars are born with innately powerful abilities which they continue to hone and strengthen. Solars continue to learn and improve, gaining new abilities and new skills as time passes. Some solars, instead of learning new abilities, hone their already natural abilities and create new ones from pre-existing ones. Some of them try to find new ways to strengthen their power for the evil that they will soon face. But even with all their powers and abilities Solars have their preferred way of doing combat. When a solar is newly born or newly reincarnated, they already have a plethora of powerful abilities that will aid them and others in their growth.

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Angelic Weapon** - The weapons that solars use immediately get infused by their divine nature and exude radiant power dealing more damage. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Divine Awareness** - The solar sees through all lies and deceit. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Healing Touch** - The body of the solar is filled with a near infinite amount of divine energy that allows them empower and heal anybody they touch. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Magic Resistance** - The body of the solar is purely divine in nature and allows them  to resist magical effects easily. It gives them advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Solar Sight** - The solar's natural sight is supernaturally powerful.

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Teleport** - A solar can easily bend space to their will and teleport in and out of the battlefield.

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Divine Nature** - The divine nature of the solar allows them to manifest multiple abilities stemming from their own bodies. They are also immune to necrotic and poison damage and cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, or poisoned. They also have natural resistance to radiant and bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

> ##### DM Notes
> The powers above are the basic abilities of a solar in the official MM. They are meant to be a permanent addition to any solar character I plan to introduce in this compendium. It is also a guideline for their basic abilities, should you plan to create your own personal Solar. 

### Field of judgement
Solars are capable of summoning their true power when they are in their field of judgement. A solar's field of judgement is where they are at their absolute peak. The field can be equated to a powerful dragon or a demon lord's lair. If a solar dies or is banished, these effects fade over the course of 100 years.

### Fate and Destinies
While it is undeniable that most beings are intertwined by fate and it is mostly unchangeable, the solars are exempt from fate. Born into existence with only one thing in mind, the solars are fateless but knew what they were created for. 

It is not uncommon for apocalypses that were meticulously planned by the gods or similar beings to be suddenly stopped by a nearby solar or a solar whose jurisdiction is being challenged. 

Usually for a prophecy that would confer planetary destruction, the masterminds need to negotiate with the solars. And if any single one of the solars is unconvinced they have every right to join in and ruin the created prophecy. 

### True Divinity
While one could argue that deities are the most divine beings and none could surpass them in those terms, this is untrue. While deities claim to be divine, a large majority of them were born in the astral sea. 

The purest form of divinity that has blessed the multiverse are the solars. Born from the divine embryo that birthed the positive plane, the solars continue their mission. Whatever their mission is, the solars must continue to care for the balance. 

The blood of solars is golden and it is the liquid manifestation of the energies of the positive realms. While near impossible to harm, powerful creatures that fought the solars have wounded them. Their blood is said to contain strong healing properties and sometimes used for powerful rituals.

There have been cases where some solars have willingly given their blood to mortals as a reward. So there is at least some form of credence to it. The blood of solars is capable of healing all wounds, resurrecting the dead, banishing fiends, destroying undead, and even turn a mortal into a powerful immortal. 

### Source of Power
While it might seem that solars have their own power sources, which is true, all solars draw more power from the positive realms when they need it. This is what makes the solars so powerful. They have a near infinite power source which allows them to fight continuously.  

While all solars are already powerful they can become more powerful by fusing with the power the heavens already provide for them. 

> ##### Epic Solars
> To those who think that my solars are weak. You can use this as lore for how the solars became stronger. You can use the epic versions of my solars created by Dave2008 or me. If time permits, they will be posted later in the compendium.

\pagebreakNum

### Exalted Mortals
Mortals have always piqued the interest of deities, demons, devils and angels alike but never to the point of being too invested. Sometimes a deity would find a worthy cleric, a fiend would find a worthy warlock and an angel would find a worthy paladin and just like them, a solar finds a worthy mortal to bless with their power.

The gift of a solar is said to be comparable to the gift of a deity, an ancient fiend or an all powerful angel. It is not uncommon for an exalted mortal to become extremely famous. Some of them even challenge the gods, to the chagrin of the deities, as some of them would rather not deal with the solars. 

And unlike most fiends, solars do their best to guide the mortals they blessed to develop as much as they can. Many solars have found a calling in being teachers as well as being guardians. 

### Archetypes
While all solars are born powerful, they have created their own fighting style for combat. Because of their endless fight, solars have created their own styles that even other beings imitate. 

There have been cases where solars have passed down their own fighting styles to other beings that they find worthy.

> ##### Class Archtypes
> Class Archtypes will later be introduced in the Solar Compendium.

### A Solar's Nature
Despite all their power and their immortality, solars are inherently good beings. Corrupting a solar to evil is a sin so great that all solars would band together to destroy the abomination that was once their sibling. Once the corrupted solar has been destroyed, its essence would be gathered once more and recreated into a brand new solar.

A corrupted solar cannot be allowed to exist as their existence slowly corrupts the positive plane where they draw their energy. In addition, if a corrupted solar manages to stave of its obliteration, it can start drawing power from the negative plane as well, fueling their bodies with power from the two planes. This would make the corrupted solar a ticking time bomb. The corrupted solar's body will eventually reach its limit since its body is filling up with two opposite energies and it will explode in a cataclysmic explosion that will most likely destroy the universe it is in. 

This apocalyptic event is what the solars are trying to prevent when one of their siblings is corrupted. 

### Death and Resurrection 
When demons and devils are slain, they return to the Abyss and Nine Hells respectively. When angels die, their divine energy returns to their god, so that the deity they may recreate their recently destroyed soldier. 

If that is the case then what happens to a destroyed solar, a creation that does not come from any deity but instead from the positive planes.

There is simply one rule when it comes to solars. Only 24 can exist at any given time, no more and no less. Once a solar dies or slain, the positive realms collect their scattered essence and start to recreate the solar. It would take 24 years for the solar to be resurrected. Should the solar be corrupted and die, the realms take its essence and disassemble it to create a brand new solar. This process is done in the core of the positive planes or the place where the divine embryo exists. 

It is rumored that if a solar in the divine embryo is slain, it will never be resurrected again. This task is almost impossible as the divine embryo is guarded by faceless beings that can slay even the greatest of enemies. These entities are called proto-solars. The proto-solars are guardians of the divine embryo that ensure the solars are properly resurrected or reincarnated.

### Infinity Magic
There are five tiers of magic, each level stronger marginally stronger than the magic below them. The strongest form of magic in existence is infinity magic. In its simplest of forms, infinity magic is simply understanding it in an infinite context, thus giving you full control and power over said concept. The first creator and progenitor of infinity magic is Xephalam, the first solar.

With nigh omnipotent power and godlike wisdom, Xephalam created the first two infinity magic, which is divinity and creation. The next beings who created the new forms of infinity magic is Magnus and Xephalam's forgotten student. They respectively created the infinity magic, Knowledge and Oblivion. This four forms of infinity magic stayed the same until Xephalam created another form, which is eternity.

**Mechanics of Infinity Magic.** Infinity magic gives the creator a handful of extremely powerful bonuses, that border nigh omnipotence, making the creator above even the gods.

### True Magic
The second strongest magic in existence is True Magic. In its simplest form, True Magic is the full understanding of a specific concept and thus allows you powerful control over that type of magic. True Magic is split into three subparts. The first is Body Concept which allows you to fuse the concept to your body. The second is Reality Concept which allows you to will reality according to your concept. The third is Will Concept which allows you to affect others with your concept in ways that is not classified as offensive.

When calculating the DC's needed for True Magic abilities, the formula is: 

**10 + Proficiency Bonus + Concept's Modifier** 

Concept Modifier is specific to the concept mastered. 
___
___
True magic gives the following bonuses:

##### Body Concept.
Body Concept is the act of fusing the understanding of a concept to the body, this is one of the main powers of true magic. Due to this fusing, body concept is purely defensive in nature.

##### Reality Concept.
Reality Concept is the act of willing reality to follow your concept's rules. Due to its powerful nature, reality concept is purely offensive in nature. 

##### Will Concept.
Will Concept is the act of willing your concept to other beings in a non-offensive way. Due to its nature, will concept is purely utility in nature. 

> ##### Mastering True Magic
>
>Player Characters can eventually learn and master their own true magic which will be detailed into the later parts of the compendium.

## *Ragani "The Wings of True Flame"*
##### "As fire tempers steel, hardships temper the  soul - Ragani."

There was once a legendary city called Variaden. Variaden was a beautiful and prosperous city. Travellers from all over the world would go to this city and sigh in awe, realizing that no city would ever rival this one, whether it be in the past or in the future. Something as rich and beautiful as this city would be coveted by greedy and malicious beings. It quickly garnered the attention of thousands of powerful beings, even Ragani.

War found Variaden quick. Kingdoms, cults, clans, tribes, and even planar beings forwarded their hand to try and make Variaden their own. A war erupted, so widespread that it threatened to destroy all of civilization. Despite the war, Ragani made no acts to stop it or prevent it. Ragani kept watch over the city. After a long and ardous battle, the solar almost left, labeling the war as a trifling matter, until he found the reason of the city's prosperity.

Underneath the city, there was a legendary beast capable of planetary destruction and it was asleep. The city leeched off its limitless energy to supply everything from magic items to simple everyday life. The energy the city siphoned was enough to keep the beast sleeping indefinitely but the war threatened to disturb its slumber. When Ragani realized the danger of this creature, he finally decided to act. 

Legends are told of an awe-inspiring and deadly form burning with fire, slowly descending from the heavens and obliterating the city of Variaden. Meteors rained that day and destroyed every last bit of Variaden. There are no records of what happened in Variaden, but if one were to travel to the ruined city, they would only find a burnt city and a wasteland, incapable of supporting life. 

Ragani is a solar that treated the plane of elemental fire as his home and has long since integrated its fiery power into his own. His appearance has been affected by his time in the plane of elemental fire as well. His eyes burn with the combined intensity of radiance and fire, eternally mixing with each other. His original wings have long since burned from the plane's element and have been replaced with a combination of his divine and the plane's fire energy. 
 
Ragani's motivations are simple: to burn all evil until the universe becomes peaceful. As righteous and as pure his mission is, Ragani appears as anything but those. His crimson skin, burning eyes, and wings made of divine flame inspire fear in both his enemies and allies. Ragani charges into battle with his Burnt Greatsword cutting armies upon armies of his enemies, while his wings burn anyone who dares to attack him.

Ragani will only act if a great threat or evil threatens to destroy the peace he wishfully wants.

### Ragani's Field of Judgement
Ragani's field of judgement is any location inhabited by an extremely powerful evil capable of upturning the balance of a plane. He must first deem an opponent evil and powerful enough to warrant activating his field. Once he activates his field, a 1000 mile radius would be consumed by his divine fire, leaving it as a burnt wasteland incapable of supporting life for 100 years. Ragani's CR increases to 28 (120,000 XP) inside his field.

Once in his field Ragani gains the following bonuses:
- The damage from Ragani's Burnt Angelic Weapons increases from 3d8 fire damage plus 3d8 radiant damage to 4d8 fire damage plus 4d8 radiant damage. 
- Ragani's attacks, abilities and spells that deal fire damage ignore fire resistance and treat immunity as resistance.
- While in his field, Ragani regains 50 hit points at the start of his turn. 

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties). Ragani can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The burning winds of the field start to condense on a point Ragani can see within 150 feet of him, creating a 10 foot radius of burning wind around that point. Each creature in that area of the condensed burning wind must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage and gain one level of exhaustion on a failed save, or half as much damage and do not gain one level of exhaustion on a successful one.  
- Ragani absorbs the flames in the field, healing him for 5 hit points for every fire based spell cast since the last time this lair action was used. He heals an additional 5 hit points for every time he dealt fire damage to a creature since the last time this lair action was used. Area of effect abilities and spells heal him for every creature hit. 
- When Ragani's hit points reach 300 or below, he can choose to stab his Greatsword into the ground, losing the ability to attack with it and the ability to teleport. He then gathers his divine and fire energy for 3 rounds. In additon, all creatures within 150 feet of Ragani cannot move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means. At the end of his channel he releases a powerful and devastating blast of energy around him in a 1000 feet radius. All creatures within the range must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 110 (20d10) radiant damage and 110 (20d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This attack ignores resistance and treats immunity as resistance. If Ragani is successful in using this ability, he regains all of his hit points. If Ragani takes 250 damage in one round, his concentration is broken, making the gathered energy dissipate. After Ragani uses this ability, he can no longer use any of his lair actions, but will retain the bonuses from his field of judgement.

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Ragani is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- All plant life in the field die and cannot be resurrected unless by magical means.
- Water sources dry up and cannot be refilled unless by magical means.
- Healing from any source is maximized for fire based creatures while they are resting 

> ## Variant: Mythic Ragani
>
> If you believe that Ragani is lacking in power, you can use his mythic variant which adds a new layer of power unto his base kit.
>
> **The Hottest Fire (Mythic Trait: Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If Ragani is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, he regains 300 hit points and his burning aura's range is increased to 20 feet of him and also deals 21 (6d6) fire damage.
>
> ### Mythic Actions
> If Ragani's mythic trait is active, he can use the options below as legendary actions for 1 hour after using The Hottest Fire. 
> 
> ***Incinerate (Costs 2 Actions).*** Ragani casts the spell *fireball*. 
> 
> ***Fiery Blade (Costs 3 Actions).*** Ragani makes two attacks with his Burnt Greatsword. 
>
> ***Molten Core (Costs 4 Actions).*** Ragani creates a hovering molten core adjacent to him. The molten core has 10 AC, 25 hit points, fly speed of 20 feet, resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage, and immunity to fire, poison and psychic damage. For every molten core that is active, Ragani reduces any damage he takes by 5. The Molten Cores crumble to dust when Ragani stops using The Hottest Fire.
>
> ___  
>
> *Fighting Ragani as a mythic encounter is equivalent to taking on two challenge rating 26 creatures in one encounter. Award a party 90,000 XP for defeating Ragani after he uses The Hottest Fire.*

## *Arrid "The golden heart"*
##### "Acts of goodness are not always wise, and acts of evil are not always foolish, but regardless, we shall always strive to be good - Arrid"

Angels try not to socialize with mortals, especially if it interferes with their missions and solars are more extreme. Despite the solitary nature of solars, there are some of them that actively seek to socialize with people.

A young man walked in the heat with a farmer's hat covering his head. He approached a plot of land and started to plow the fertile ground with a hoe. When he finished tilling the land, he sowed it with seeds and watered them. Once the job was done, an old farmer thanked him and offered him payment but the young man refused and simply said: "Use it when someone else is in need". 

Not knowing what he meant but given the chance to keep his money, the farmer simply nodded. The young man simply smiled and walked through the village to look for another person to help. 

Within minutes, the young man saw an old lady massaging her ankles. He saw a large basket full of fruits and its contents strewn across the floor. Immediately, he offered his help. Before the woman could deny his offer, the man's smile easily disarms her cautiousness. He did this everyday. He visited villages everyday, offering his help. Every morning he wakes up from his humble cottage, then travels towards villages, offering help for no reward. 

Because of his kindness, people would constantly give him food, clothing, and even money but most of the time, he rejects everything of monetary value, claiming that he had no need for money. 

At night, the kind young man went to his humble home. Unknown to everyone, this man's home was a ruse. He travelled to a cave near his home that was covered by an illusionary wall that only he could see.

Behind the wall was a beautiful room with luxurious furniture that only the wealthiest of the wealthy could afford. There was a woman so beautiful it would have been a sin to not be entranced by her. But even with the woman's extremely alluring charms, the man did not react and he kept a smile. 

"Arrid, is it time for one of your stories once more?" Despite the woman's sarcasm, Arrid noticed a small amount of excitement. "Yes Phryix." Phryix rolled her eyes and brought a chair to the threshold of the room. Arrid sat down just outside the room and a chair appeared to catch him. Arrid started to recount his mundane adventures that day and despite Phryix's attitude, she listened intently.

It was not this easy the first time. At first, Phryix would always scream obscenities towards Arrid but after the first weeksm she eventually calmed down. Despite calming down, she refused to listen and would always try to find a way to trick Arrid or destroy the magic holding her prisoner. That quickly became stale and so, Arrid and Phryix were on talking terms. It has been a long time now but Arrid remembered every day they've been together. 

"You know it'll never work." 

Phryix interrupted Arrid's story but he smiled and continued, safe in the knowledge that he and his siblings have never erred before.

Time passed with this routine continuing over and over until one day.

"Arrid I want to go out" 

Arrid smiled and calmly stood up and stared at the woman in front of him. Arrid waved his hand and the wall made out of 9 colors suddenly disappeared. Phryix slowly moved her hand through where the wall used to be. Her hands shake intensely and she charges Arrid. 

Her hands were shaking intensely as she charged at Arrid. Arrid did nothing and accepted her attack. Phryix hugged him tightly with slight tears staining her cheeks. 

"I can't believe it Arrid. You did it." 

Arrid smiled one last time and stared into Phryix's eyes 

"It wasn't me. It was all you demon lord Phryix."

Arrid strives to see and look for the goodness in every being's hearts even the most heartless ones. He usually disguises himself when in the presence of mortals. Arrid refuses to find and pledge himself to a god, believing that pledging himself to a god will restrict him in helping others. He did not integrate other elements into his body but chose to hone his already powerful arsenal of skills and mastered physical combat. Arrid's most potent ability is his powerful control over his healing abilities. 

He honed his healing powers to the point of mastery which caused it to evolve. His healing abilities, when in his field of judgement, can now revive the dead. Despite his focus on healing magic, he is not weak in the field of combat. Unlike his other siblings, Arrid uses giant shields capable of smashing enemies to a pulp when he needs to but it is the most effective weapon to protect others from harm. 

Surprisingly Arrid's charismatic and patient character has earned the respect and favor of many powerful allies. Allies that some of his siblings would be hard-pressed to defeat. This technically makes Arrid one of the more dangerous solars should he ask for the help of his friends but that is unlikely the case since solars would never allow others to fight for them.

It is both an insult to them and to their kind. 

### Arrid's Field of Judgement
Arrid's field of judgement is any location inhabited by a being who changed for the better but decided to revert to their evil ways. Another way for him to activate his field is if thousands of innocent have perished in an area. If Arrid deems a being worthy of using his field and his requirements are met, he can use it. Once Arrid uses his field, a 1000 mile radius would be filled by his divine energy influencing the people that live there for 100 years. Arrid's CR increases to 30 (155,000 XP) inside his field.

Once in his field Arrid gains the following bonuses:
- Evil creatures or creatures, that Arrid chooses, have their speed reduced by half and they cannot increase it by any magical means, unless they leave the field.
- Arrid can use his Healing Touch an unlimited amount of times.
- Arrid's *healing word* spell also acts as the spell *raise dead*.  
- Arrid gains resistance to all types of damage.
- When Arrid casts the spell *prismatic wall*, each wall will have three copies instead of two.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Arrid can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Arrid weeps for the innocents he could not save and gathers his anger to obliterate the perpetrator. If one of Arrid's companions was killed or damaged by another creature in the last round, he can conjure a 150-foot cone of pure divine energy from his hands. Every creature in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Arrid calms himself along with every creature in a 100-foot radius around him, extinguishing every creature's violent impulses. Every creature in the area must make a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw. If a creature succeeds nothing happens, but if a creature fails that creature cannot attack or cast spells that deal damage or force someone to make a saving throw for 1 minute. This effect ends when they are damaged. Creatures, that are immune to being charmed, are not affected. Creatures can repeat their saving throw at the start of their turn to end the effect on themselves.
- Arrid casts a 9th level *healing word* spell on 3 creatures of his choice within 100 feet of him that he can see. 

## Regional effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Arrid is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- All plant life in the field gets rejuvenated and will grow indefinitely until the field disappears.
- Water sources are capable of healing but its effects only work when inside the field. The water is treated as a common healing potion when drunk.
- Every good creature becomes kindhearted and caring while neutral creatures become influenced to do good while evil creatures become inhibited, thus becoming neutral in nature.

## *Gaeshema "The God Fist"*
##### "A true master is an eternal student - Gaeshma"
It is not everyday that you see anyone capable of punching a balor's head off. The weapons of solars are very powerful. The gods would be hard-pressed to imitate these items without expending a lot of power. Ragani's Burnt Greatsword, Arrid's Golden Tower Shield, and Taciax' Scythe are prime examples. Despite the power of their weapons, there is one solar that refuses to use them, believing that the body is the ultimate weapon and should be honed constantly. 

Gaeshema loves combat and fighting powerful beings regardless of their nature. Other solars would avoid Gaeshema, not because they're afraid of him but because the more conscientious solars think of the collateral damage they would cause. Gaeshema believes that defeating the opponent is important, no matter the cost. Despite being chaotic, Gaeshema is a good person but believes that sometimes casualties are unavoidable. 

Gaeshema, like most of the solars, has created his own fighting style but unlike most solars, Gaeshema has barely practiced his usage of divine energy. This lack of practice lead to the weakening of some of his natural abilities but in exchange for this, Gaeshema is one of the most powerful close combat fighters in the ranks of the solars. 

This has lead to some dangerous situations, while solars are solitary fighters their enemies are not. There are some times where Gaeshema's lack of mastery of his divine powers had put him in a tight spot. 

But every time Gaeshema escaped one, he would strive to improve and improve, making sure not to get caught the next time. Eventually the years of constant improving put the legendary solar in a dilemma. He could not improve anymore. He was stuck at a point where he could no longer learn anything else. His skills have reached the physical perfection any fighter would wish for. 

Distraught, Gaeshema travelled the multiverse fighting powerful beings while doing his best to help people, in hope of a breakthrough. 

Years passed by and Gaeshema was beginning to lose hope in learning more until one day, a group of people came to meet him. A solar's memory is only equalled by an Aboleth and Illithid's memory, so Gaeshema immediately recognized these people. The group was a conglomeration of people he has saved from different places all over the multiverse. How they found him or even reached him is a mystery but Gaeshema was temporarily distracted from his plight and decided to see what would happen.

This group of people wanted to express their thanks to their savior and convey their complete awe and reverence before Gaeshema's martial prowess. Gaeshema received the praise humbly but he wanted to continue his journey to find something that can help him improve. 

Before Gaeshema could leave, the leader of the group asked for his attention. Gaeshema stopped and turned around to see what the person wanted. 

In perfect sync, the whole group bows and asks Gaeshema to teach and guide them. 

Surprised, Gaeshema was about to reject them but an epiphany struck him.

If he were to teach them, it might help him improve. Gaeshema agreed. It was at this day the monastic tradition of the Divine Fist was developed. Throughout the years Gaeshema almost forgot his reason for teaching. He instilled into his students the basic tenants of the Divine Fist: 
- To protect the innocent
- To vanquish evil, wherever it might be
- To improve oneself and to never stop improving
___
Gaeshema found himself at peace. One day while remembering the past, Gaeshema started to practice again to see if his skills deteriorated or weakened but to his surprise, Gaeshema started to see differences in his moves and his students. In his years of constant teaching, he saw thousands of variations of his skills and moves. After reviewing them and studying them, Gaeshema started to train once more. Slowly but surely Gaeshema saw improvement. He started to train more intensely rivaling his first days of training. 

Despite being a Solar, Gaeshema's ultimate goal is to be the strongest he can possibly be and fighting for good is only a path towards that goal. He adamantly refuses the invitation of any god believing that once he pledges his power under a deity, he will have more restrictions and less time to improve himself. His divine powers have weakened considerably but he can still use them. If it comes to personal combat, only the strongest solars and bravest fiends can come close to defeating Gaeshema. He does not use the legendary weapons that all solars have with them. Instead Gaeshema uses his God Fists, a pair of legendary gloves forged by his fights with powerful beings all over the multiverse.

Gaeshema is the leader of the Divine Fist temple, a collection of powerful monks that fight with their bodies while being boosted by divine energy gifted to them by Gaeshema. 

Gaeshema appears very humble and simple when traveling around the multiverse. While traveling, he sometimes find worthy individuals and he challenges them to fights in his mortal form and if they are skilled, he invites them to his temple. He only enters his true form when a worthy and powerful opponent shows itself. He wears an unbreakable robe suited for battle while his wings are transformed into armguards that hook themselves to his arms from his back. 

### Gaeshema's Field of Judgement
Gaeshema's  requirements are very simple. Because of his lack of control over his divine power, his field is very unstable compared to the other solars. The first requirement is that he must be fighting a powerful and evil opponent. The second requirement is that this being is capable of defeating him. If Gaeshema has fulfilled the requirements and activates his field, a 1000 mile radius area would be filled by his raw divine energy along with his ki. The field will stay for 100 years before it dissipates. Gaeshema's CR increases to 30 (155,000 XP) inside his field. 

Once in his field Gaeshema gains the following bonuses:

- Gaeshema's speed cannot be reduced by any means.
- When moving out of an enemy's range, Gaeshema never provokes an oppurtunity attack. 
- Instead of reacting once per round, Gaeshema can react 5 times.
- Gaeshema's deflect missile trait's damage reduction is changed to 94 (4d10 + 72).

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Gaeshema can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Gaeshema throws a powerful punch towards a creature in front of him. The creature must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3 times the damage of Gaeshema's God Fist Gauntlets. On a successful save, it instead takes normal damage instead.
- Gaeshema controls the air flow of the field, giving him a +5 to AC against ranged attacks until he uses another lair action. 
- Gaeshema releases a powerful burst of divine energy in a 120-foot radius around him. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 38 (7d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Gaeshema is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Afterimages and visions of Gaeshema's previous fights frequently appear here. 
- While in the field everyone will feel more energetic and lively.
- Meditation here gives people a chance to be enlightened on fighting. For the next 24 hours, when they roll a 1 or 2 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, they can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
- Portals connected to the Divine Fist temple sometimes appear.

In addition, each creature within 60 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be knocked 50 feet away and knocked prone.

If Gaeshma reduces the damage to 0, he can catch the missile if it is small enough for him to hold in one hand and if he has at least one hand free. If Gaeshema catches a missile in this way, he can make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition he just caught as part of the same reaction. This attack has a 40/120 range and counts as a God Fist Gauntlet weapon attack for damage purposes. In addition, Gaeshema can instead use all of his reactions to catch a spell that uses a ranged spell attack and redirect it back to the caster as though it originated from him, turning the caster into the target.

## *Velik "Heaven's Marksman"*
##### "The bow is the court, the victim the string, the target the guilty and the arrow is the judge - Velik"

Despite a solar's innate nature of being good, their definition of good sometimes become skewed. A mortal's understanding is not the same as the understanding of an eternal being. To see the multiverse change infinitely is sometimes maddening but not for those who have purpose. While a mortal would fret over the death of a singular entity, an eternal would not. Velik is a prime example of this attitude. He would never move his hands if a single mortal was being threatened, something Arrid takes displeasure in, but will gladly charge in first if an event risking the balance is worth his attention. 

This is not to say that Velik turns a blind eye towards minor transgressions of evil acts. Should Velik be in the vicinity of an evil act, whether it be minor or major, he would proceed to judge the aggressor or in some cases the victim. The only time he would ignore a minor evil act is if he is not near the vicinity and if something major occurred and he needs to react immediately. 

Just like every solar, Velik himself is a judge. He judges everyone fairly with his legendary bow and unerring accuracy. Velik also incurs the anger of multiple enemies purely because of his attitude. His cold and unresponsive demeanor has made him the loner of the solar family but Arrid tries his best to socialize with Velik even if it irritates him. 

Velik has no grey area. All solars used to have no grey areas but as time passed some of them understood that not all evil actions are worth a heavy hand and only needed proper guidance while some good actions are worth punishing. Arrid is the biggest practitioner of this attitude making him and Velik be on not so good terms. Ironically if these two solars were to partner up, almost no one would be capable of defeating these two unstoppable celestials. 

Truth to be told, Velik lacks a grey area because of his lack of experience. Even though gifted with immortality that dragons would kill for, Velik refused to interact with the multiverse believing that honing his skills to be able to protect is more important. Eventually this caused Velik to have a closed view, believing that bad is bad and good is good. 

Maybe it is because of this reason that Velik hates Arrid. Arrid, his pure opposite in social skills and combat skills. Or maybe it is because Arrid is housing a demon lord. Even though Velik will still keep a civil attitude with him, Arrid spawned something inside Velik that solar's are not supposed to have: Hate.

Velik loves cake. The only thing he probably would call his favourite past time other than honing his skills and divine power is eating different types of cakes. This is why he tolerates the presence of Namar, a fellow Solar. 

He continuously hunts extremely powerful and evil enemies that can threaten the balance of the multiverse: Liches, Aboleths, Illithid nests, and even ancient dragons. Should he find any of their locations which is currently active, Velik will immediately hunt them down and destroy them.

The only reason why there is still evil in the multiverse is because Velik cannot be everywhere. But if he could, he would. 

His last known appearance was said to be in the material plane hunting down a legendary rogue who is in the possession of a legendary artifact called the **"Book of Names"**. 

Despite being a Solar Velik's appearance inspires fear. His wings are pure white that envelopes people with a shadow that reveals their sins. He wears a magical robe covering his body along with a hood covering his face. His wings have the unique ability of predicting attacks targeted towards him. Velik is quite a loner something Arrid both dislikes and pities. Despite this Velik constantly visits Namar to eat cake with and sometimes Ragani visits him for guidance in archery since both are expert practitioners.

### Velik's Field of Judgement
Velik's field of judgement has multiple abilities on its own. It only serves to enhance Velik's already impressive power. His requirements are not as strict as the other solars but not as lenient as Gaeshema's field. His requirements need him to know an opponents information before he can set his field. The information must be the opponent's name, alignment, type, and basic abilities. His second requirement is that the target should be a great evil capable of massive damage. Once the requirements are met Velik can set his field increasing his power. A 1000 mile radius area would be filled with his divine energy influencing the people living there for 100 years. Velik's CR increases to 31 (175,000 XP) inside his field. 

Once in his field Velik gains the following bonuses:
- Velik does not suffer disadvantage outside of his normal range.
- Velik can see his target inside his field, no matter what. If someone tries to hide from him within his field with divination magic or illusion magic, they must succeed on a DC 27 Wisdom saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) psychic damage and the spell is dispelled on a failed save, or half as much damage and the spell is successful on a successful one.
- Velik can use his bonus action to teleport to a creature or object he can see that he hit with Heaven's Sniper. If the arrow is embedded on a creature he teleports 10 feet away from the arrow. 

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Velik can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Velik creates an arrow made out of his judgement and shoots it towards a creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or die on a failed save, or take 55 (10d8 + 10) piercing damage plus 45 (10d8) radiant damage on a successful one. This lair action cannot be used again for the next 2 rounds.
- Velik uses his mastery of archery to pinpoint all his enemies weakpoints giving him advantage on his attack rolls until he uses another lair action.
- Velik utters a command word. Every creature that was damaged by Velik's arrows must succeed on a DC 23 dexterity saving throw. On a failed save they take 13 (3d8) radiant damage plus an additonal 13 (3d8) for every time they were hit by an arrow or by Heavens Downfall since the last time this lair action was used.

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Velik is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Animals in the field become docile while forests become thicker and more alive. 
- Evil beings feel as if they are watched. If they are powerful beings, Velik can spy on them. 
- Hunters are somehow enchanted making their attacks magical.

## Taciax "The Hand of Death" 
##### "It is not death that a mortal should fear, but they should fear never beginning to live. - Taciax" 
Taciax, the legendary angel of death, is a solar pledged to a god or goddess of death. Nobody knows who the deity Taciax pledged his power to. Taciax has many titles, the Black Crow, the Infinite Void, Death, and many more but in truth he is a solar that believes in the sanctity and balance of life and death. 

He believes that no one should go past their supposed time, and that undead, especially powerful liches, are an insult to the natural balance. Despite being a Solar, Taciax leans into the neutral spectrum of alignments but this does not mean he will turn a blind eye towards evil because no matter what, a solar is always bound to do good. 

His god is said to keep herself or himself secret. His deity might be the Raven Queen, or the fair yet cold Kelemvor. Whomever his deity is, Taciax faithfully serves them as long as his wish of keeping the multiverse in balance through death is fulfilled. 

It is said that, Taciax can see undead once they are unborn. Once someone becomes undead, Taciax sees them for all they are. He sees them and pities their very existence. 

Taciax follows the commands and orders of his deity but will act on his own if no orders are given. There is one target that Taciax has been spending quite a time trying to kill. And despite hunting him, the legendary solar has yet to lay a finger on his target.

His target is a lich king, a lich that can rival the strongest and skilled warriors while easily defeating the most skilled mages and talented sorcerers. 

Ironically, the lich is alive not because the solar cannot defeat it in combat, but because the lich is not evil and the death of it would cause massive grief and damage everywhere. 

The surprisingly honest nature and endearing attitude of the all-powerful lich has captured Taciax. The Lich's name was Ounzair, an immortal that was equally talented in fighting and spellcasting.

Taciax and Ounzair have become very close friends, something that surprised many of the solars, especially Taciax. Other than keeping Ounzair in check, Taciax visits other places of evil to do maintenance. An example would be the Temple of Evil and the Temple of Nerul. 

All solars can channel divine energy through their weapons and attacks. Taciax is no exception. He can easily use his divine powers but the time in close proximity to his deity and the undead, especially Ounzair, gave Taciax new understanding of the powers he wishes to destroy. 

Taciax's appearance inspires fear but also peace. His black robe accompanied by his pure white wings, the unmistakable solar heritage, is a sign of reprieve for the mourning for they know that their loved ones are cared for by the good. Solar's have preferred weapons and Taciax favors the scythe, just like most deities of death. His legendary scythe cleaves through legions of undead and even when the time calls for it, he points it towards evil mortals that deserve the sweet release of death. 

### Taciax's Field of judgement
Taciax's field of judgement is a place of terror and hopelessness for his enemies, moments before death takes them. Taciax is an archsolar, a solar that stands above the other solars. Once Taciax activates his field, enters a more terrifying form. Taciax's ability to transform is the result of him reaching a height of power that his other siblings have yet to achieve. This earns him the title of archsolar. 

Once Taciax activates his field, a 1000 mile radius becomes night and every undead will start to burn whether they hide or live on the surface. The nights become 3 hours longer and people live longer and healthier lives for 100 years. 

Due to the extremely powerful nature of Taciax's powers instead of gaining bonuses when he is in the field, Taciax instead gets a different statblock. 

>##### Taciax "The Infinite Void" 
> If Taciax uses his field and transforms, his health is refilled to max and every spell he has cast is also refreshed. Use his second stat block. Once Taciax uses his field form, he no longer is a CR 30 creature, he is a Mid-Epic Monster. 

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties). Taciax can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Taciax pulls at the strings of one of his enemies' fates. Taciax can choose a creature he can see. He has advantage on his attack rolls against it and it has disadvantage on saving throws against Taciax until Taciax picks another creature. 
- Taciax speaks words of power. He can choose one creature that can hear him that must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or die. This lair action cannot be used again for the next 2 rounds.
- Taciax fills his scythe with death energy and swings it into the ground, releasing a 300-foot long and 30-foot wide line of death energy in front of him. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 28 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) radiant damage plus 33 (6d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. This attack ignores resistance, immunity and absorption.  

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Taciax is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:

- Corpses in Taciax's field cannot be raised to become Undead.
- Undead, fiends, fey and aberrations cannot regain hit points through resting in his field. 
- Mortals become immune to disease and can live longer once inside the field.
- Taciax can sense all undead or fiend in the field.

> If you believe that Taciax is lacking in power, you can use his mythic variant which adds a new layer of power unto his base kit.

Each creature in a 20-foot radius Sphere centered on that point must make a DC 27 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature is restrained and takes 22 (4d10) slashing damage. On a successful one, a creature takes no damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success. The metal claw has 18 AC, 50 hit points, immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.
>
> ***Rake (Costs 3 Actions).*** Taciax summons giant scythes to rake a 30-foot cone in front of him. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 33 (6d10) slashing damage and is dragged 20 feet towards Taciax. On a successful save, a creature takes no damage. 
>
> ***Succumb (Costs 4 Actions).*** Taciax lets out an aura of fatigue around 30 feet of him. Each creature in that aura must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 26 (4d12) necrotic damage and gain 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful one, a creature takes no damage.

## Taciax "The Infinite Void"
##### "Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily. - Taciax"
There was a legend that the most powerful solars rarely used their fields believing that their normal state was enough. There were four of them, four solars that even gods would rather not meet even if it meant befriending them.

Taciax is one of them. Specifically Taciax is the 2nd strongest solar, only second to his absurdly powerful brother Xephalam. But should he activate his field again even gods will steer clear for no one escapes death.

## Adimus "The Forger"
##### "The finest steel must go through the hottest fire. - Adimus"

To create is the realm of gods. If the gods created the mortals who created the gods? A question that will never have an answer for it only goes back and back to the first one who created who. 

Adimus pondered this question for thousands of years. The question ate him up. It was a small knocking sound in his mind that he could not purge no matter what. 

He tried his best to find an answer until his constant travel brought him to the realm of blacksmiths, the realm of the legendary blacksmith god. While walking through the blacksmith god's realm, he heard a pounding stronger than the knocking in his mind and he pursued it. 

Despite barging in the realm of a deity, no one stopped the running solar. They were just as busy, pursuing their own mastery of smithing. Adimus slammed a door open and saw something that kept him in awe. 

Adimus saw the clash of metal between a hammer and an anvil. 

Adimus saw the god of smithing, the king of steel, the lord of forges, and the emperor of weapons, forging. Despite his rude entrance, Adimus did not apologize, not because of lack of manners but because the Deity did not pay him heed. 

The smith god did not react to Adimus' rude entrance and continued his trance like hammering of the divine metal. Adimus stood there watching in intense excitement and in complete utter awe as he saw the godlike forgemaster do his work. 

Days passed as the smith god constantly hammered the divine metal, slowly molding it and forging it into a piece that even the other gods would kill for. 

Adimus watched intently studying every swing and every pounding. He saw every movement as a form of art and saw how beautiful the act of creating is.

Adimus did not notice but the slow knocking has long been knocked away by the powerful pounding of the Deity. A realization dawned on the solar.

"It doesn't matter who creates you, in the end what truly matters is what you create." 

When Adimus uttered those words to himself, the smith god stopped and looked at him with a gentle yet fierce smile. 

Once the pounding stopped, the knocking came back but this time it was weaker. Adimus knew what this place meant and he knew in some way that his question lead him here. 

The smith god invited Adimus to be a personal apprentice but this somehow irked the solar. 

Adimus instead asked the smith god to allow him to become the lowest ranking apprentice instead. He wished to start from the bottom. 
The request surprised the smith god but he immediately agreed to it, obviously happy and impressed with Adimus' decision. Adimus was given the basics of blacksmithing. 

Adimus kept to himself but was constantly visited by smith god to watch the solar forge. Adimus refused help but kept visiting other blacksmiths and the smith god to watch them work. 

At first, Adimus had a hard time to make his own wares but eventually the solar learned to wield the tools needed to create. 

He created swords, axes, great swords, and more. Adimus created the finest weaponry only rivaled by the legendary smith god himself. Spending an eternity with the tools for creation, Adimus learned to create and mold.

Eventually, Adimus created wonderous items and artifacts that other gods would be jealous of. 

Adimus loved what he was doing and now understood what creation was meant to be. He pledged himself to the smith deity so that he may be able to preserve creation through his own hands and if needed, his legendary armaments. 

It is said that thousands of benevolent beings have come near and far to ask for an item created by him. Of these beings, he befriended dragons the most, especially silver ones. Due to his work, he has thousands of other allies who would gladly help him in creating weapons. One of his closest ally and friend is an ancient golden dragon, who helped him create a favorite weapon of his.

Wearing his legendary plate armor Adimus charges into battle without any weapons in sight. His enemies mistake him for another monk like Gaeshema but suddenly the heavily built solar summons a greatsword and blocks his enemies' advance. Then he summons a warhammer to ground their bones to dust. After the warhammer, he summons a sharp katana that cleaves through his enemies's defenses. Then conjures a large glaive immediately ripping through swathes and swathes of enemies. 

His legendary form in battle inspires fear and awe throughout the planes.  

### Adimus' Field of Judgement
Adimus' field is a place of smithing. A giant anvil appears in the center where Adimus creates his field. The giant anvil is made out of magically enchanted adamantine that is completely unbreakable, save from the most powerful attacks capable of sundering planets. When fighting, Adimus constantly changes weapons but once inside his field, he can fight with all his weapons without limitation as if every weapon follows his command. His requirements are just like the other solar's requirements. His first requirement is that his enemy should be a powerful evil being that wishes to destroy or erase life. His second requirement is that he ensures that nobody is in the near vicinity of his battlefield. Once the requirements are met Adimus can set his field increasing his power. A 1000 mile radius area would be filled with his divine domain infused energy influencing the people and materials existing there for 100 years. Adimus's CR increases to Low-Epic (200,000 XP) inside his field.   

Once inside his field Adimus gains the following bonuses: 
- Adimus' AC increases to 28
- Adimus gains 250 temporary hit points which regenerate at dawn, as long as Adimus is inside his field.   
- Adimus gains immunity to fire and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from rare or lesser magical weapons. 
- Any time Adimus is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, Adimus is unaffected. On a 6, Adimus is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from Adimus, turning the caster into the target. 

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties). Adimus can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Adimus summons his **Unlimited Forge Works**. A seemingly unlimited amount of weapons fall from the sky covering a 500-foot-radius area around Adimus and striking his opponents as they land. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) magical bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage (Adimus' Choice) and 70 (20d6) lightning, cold or fire damage (Admius' Choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. This damage ignores resistances. After using this lair action, Adimus cannot use it again for the next 24 hours. Adimus can dismiss any number of weapons with an action. 
- Adimus can order up to ten weapons to release their enchantments and use the released magic to attack up to ten creatures within his field. Each creature must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) magical bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage (Adimus' Choice) and 21 (6d6) lightning, cold or fire damage (Adimus' Choice) on failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
- Once Adimus uses his Unlimited Forge Works, he can pick up and make a melee attack with a summoned weapon of a type of his choice against a creature within his weapons range. Any weapon he picks up will follow the damage of the usual weapon except that he will use triple the damage dice instead. Any weapon picked up, has one major effect and two minor effects randomly determined by rolling on the following tables.

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Adimus is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Blacksmiths will have inspiring dreams on ingenious weapon designs.
- Enchanting processes will have a lower chance of failing.
- Rare metals and materials become common while very rare materials become rare and legendary materials become very rare. 

## Adimus' Legendary Artifacts
Adimus has and is still creating magical items and weapons since the moment the smith god admitted him into his domain but he has created 4 legendary artifacts that he always brings when going to combat.

### Heaven's Edge
All Solars are born with a greatsword but not all of them use it to combat the forces of evil. A prime example of this is Gaeshema who destroyed his greatsword and fused it into his own body which eventually turned into his legendary gauntlets. Another example is Velik who fused his greatsword with his slayer bow transforming it into his Heaven's Sniper. 

When Adimus mastered the ways of creating weapons and magic items, Adimus melted his greatsword and reforged it in the fires of the primordial forges and fused it with divine metal that made his already powerful greatsword into a blade capable of slaying demon lords.

The adamantine grip supported by a platinum pommel and topped with a golden hilt inspires awe in his allies and injects fears in his enemies. It is this blade that truly shows the peak of his skill. The legendary blade made out of an unknown metal easily cuts through the toughest of defenses and would easily destroy the strongest of armor.

\pagebreakNum

### Hellbreaker
After his recreation of his greatsword, Adimus was visited by Ragani. Ragani was impressed with his brother's craftsmanship but the reason he came was not for weapons but to ask Adimus to face him in combat. Adimus, being a solar, gladly accepted. Confident in his newly forged weapons, Adimus thought he would be able to easily defeat the true flame. 

To his surprise, Ragani defeated the forge master with ease. After his defeat, Ragani said that his visit was something that all the other solars agreed to. His passion for forging has made him weaker and he forgot to train to better himself.

Guilty with shame, Adimus apologized. Nothing is more shameful than a solar that cannot protect the good.

With this hot shame filling his being, Adimus created the legendary warhammer named Hellbreaker. He trained himself with it along with his other weapons. Using this powerful warhammer, Adimus can manipulate gravity to lock down his opponents while making sure he isn't affected. Just as gravity is heavy to his enemies, his burden is just as heavy.

### Voidcutter
All solars have emotions and the strongest of these are righteousness, justice, guilt and most of all emptiness. A solar will always feel righteous, justice ridden and almost never guilty but should the time come when they feel the cold unfeeling touch of emptiness, it manifests into dreaded beings that can even contend with solars. They are called the Divine Cold, beings of pure void.

The first appearance of these beings was when Adimus failed to protect a city with his legendary armaments. He failed to defeat a powerful demon lord and the cost was the destruction of a city, with the loss of millions of lives. The loss affected him so much that for the first time since forever his forges went cold. It was at this time when the cold and empty being came into existence. It attacked the distracted solar and managed to wound it but was put down by the solar before it could cause any more damage. 

After seeing the divine cold's corpse, Adimus felt even more pained. It was truly the manifestation of his complete and utter failure. Determined to never repeat his failure again, Adimus took the remains of the destroyed divine cold and heated his cold forge. He toiled for days until he created a sharp single edged blade that would cut his enemies and destroy their guards with the cold that Adimus felt. 

### Mountain Storm
Lightning is a tricky thing when it comes to solars. Not all of them use it but Adimus found its powerful effects to be extremely good in clearing large waves of evil doers. He traveled into the quasi-elemental plane of lightning and took the Heart of the Storms from the Elemental Prince of Air in exchange for a weapon that the prince took interest in. 

The Forger went back to his deity's realm and started to forge a weapon that would even make lightning elementals shiver at the power they can possibly harness. 

The Mountain storm can generate large amounts of lightning capable of, as its name suggests, cover a mountain and fill it with powerful storms. 

Aptly named as Mountain storm, Adimus charges to battle with his legendary weapons and always charges forward as destructive as a storm. In combat, Adimus uses Mountain Storm to defeat many enemies and make sure they are paralyzed.

## Clarion "The Metaphysical King"
##### "Mind over matter, literally" - Clarion"
Mystics are said to be a rare breed. If there is one magic user in one thousand people then there is one mystic in one million people. But does this apply to beings as powerful as solars? In truth, only one solar practices the usage of psionic powers and his name is Clarion. 

To attain the mental peace that mystics have, Clarion is usually out of sorts. He refuses to participate in small skirmishes against evil but would be one of the first solars to go in battle if something big comes to threaten the multiverse.

Unlike the other solars, Clarion likes to travel while honing his mind, perfecting his control and sharpening his wit. He lacks the common weakness of other solars of having a hard time socializing and if it was not for his eccentricity, only Arrid would be a better conversationalist than him. 

Clarion is called an eccentric because of his weird activities. An example of his weird behavior is when Clarion visits houses in the middle of the night to ask for food, when he clearly does not need to eat to live. Sometimes he bathes in milk, an odd practice for someone who does not need to bath and definitely bizarre for someone who does.  

Because of honing his mind, Clarion is in very good terms with his fellow solar Gaeshema, who focuses on honing his body. They both spar and meditate when they meet. Because of Clarion's good yet quirky social skills, he earned the good will of the kind Arrid. And despite all of this, he is serious when things become rough, earning him some good points with Velik.

A reason why Clarion is quirky is because of the special nature of his responsibilities. While all solars help vanquish evil, some of them have their own specialties. Taciax destroys undead with zeal, Ragani takes a firm stand against the elementals, Arrid and Velik have their way against demons and Gaeshema loves punching malevolent giants. Clarion's job sometimes tend to be more difficult. 

He constantly visits the far realm. He goes out the vast expanse of the void to go to the far realm. If asked why he does that, it is because he is the celestial ambassador between the two separate multiverses. When asked what he sees and knows about the far realm he calmly replies that it's just like our universe but slightly different. 

When asked what types of evil he stops, he answers that he stops the extremely powerful elder beings but lets go of beings such as aboleths or illithids because their level of power is not enough to threaten the universe in its entirety. But sometimes even elder evils and the deeps ones manage to escape his sight and break into the multiverse. 

When the time comes that they do break into the multiverse, Clarion takes the near impossible task of destroying the alien being by himself and if destroying them is impossible, Clarion banishes them back to the far realm. 

Despite his extended time being exposed to the far realms, Clarion retains his sanity albeit he acquired some small quirky habits. 

Retaining one's sanity when faced with the great horrors outside the universe is something that only beings that are as powerful as the solars can do. 

Despite his eternal watch over the far realm, Clarion has fought other forces multiple times such as the armies of hell, the legion of the abyss, and even the strongest of primordials.

Unfortunately, his time alone did not allow for him to form any intimate bonds with other beings. Even Velik is acquainted with Arrid's friend. 

The exception is one little nightmarish being that he has sealed deeply inside his body. Something that most beings don't know is that Clarion's divine body is the host of an extremely powerful elder one. He sealed it into himself, afraid of releasing it into the multiverse but every once in a while, the solar uses the large reserves of power of the alien to help him. He sometimes visits it, unnerved by the alien creature. 


### Clarion's Field of Judgement
Clarion's field is not something he activates lightly. His time in the far realms has warped his field beyond recognition. His field has transformed into something akin to the far realm itself.

When the requirements are met Clarion can activate his field filling a 1000 mile radius with his psychic energy and divine magic for 100 years. Clarion's CR increases to Low-Epic (200,000 XP) inside his field.  

Once in his field Clarion gains the following bonuses:

- Clarion can telepathically hear every thought and can talk to every being telepathically inside his field, even if the creatures have no telepathic ability themselves.
- No level or power of divination magic can shield Clarion's ability to see through anyone inside his field. 
- Physics in his field become weird. Each time a creature other than Clarion hits with a weapon attack, it must roll a d6. On a 1 the attack misses. If Clarion would miss with a weapon attack, roll a 1d6. On a 6 the attack hits and is considered a crit.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Clarion can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Clarion releases a psychic surge in a 30-foot sphere with him as the center. Each creature in the sphere that Clarion chooses must make on a DC 27 Wisdom saving throw or lose their psychic resistance and immunity on a failed save. If they don't have psychic resistance and immunity, they become vulnerable to psychic damage until Clarion uses another lair action.
- Clarion releases the pent up nightmarish energy, he stored inside him when he stayed in the far realm, in a 30-foot sphere with him as the center. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 27 Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effects of the spell *feeblemind*. This lair action can only be used three times a day. 
- Massive tentacles resembling an octupus' limbs burst out of Clarion's body attacking each creature in a 100-foot sphere with him as the center. Each creature in that sphere must succeed on a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

> ## Variant: Mythic Clarion
>
> If you believe that Clarion is lacking in power, you can use his mythic variant which adds a new layer of power unto his base kit.
>
> **The Elder (Mythic Trait: Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If Clarion is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, he regains 400 hit points. In addition, he loses his multiattack, eldritch greatsword action, and all his legendary actions but gains the following actions instead.
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The Elder makes eight tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling.
>
> ***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit* 21 (4d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target is Grappled (escape DC 24). Until this grapple ends, the target is Restrained. The Elder has eight tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.
>
> ***Fling.*** One Large or smaller object held or creature Grappled by the Elder is Thrown up to 120 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a Thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was Thrown. If the target is Thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
>
> ### Mythic Actions
> If Clarion's mythic trait is active, he can use the option below as a legendary action for 1 hour after using The Elder. 
> ___  
>
> ***Eldritch Strength.*** The Elder makes two tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of fling. 
>
> *Fighting Clarion as a mythic encounter is equivalent to taking on two challenge rating 29 creatures in one encounter. Award a party 135,000 XP for defeating Clarion after he uses The Elder.*

## Namar "The Voracious Gourmandizer"
##### "Eating good food is my favourite thing in the whole multiverse. Nothing is more blissful. - Namar"
To eat or to fight world ending beings, Namar would probably choose the former if he was not bound by nature and responsibilities. Enemies should be afraid if Namar is angry since nothing is scarier than a solar that somehow developed a concept of hunger. Namar, despite not needing sustenance, loves eating. He gained his title because of his eating habit and if not for the fact that he is a solar he would probably end his days eating. 

Because of this he is quite oftenly underestimated by enemies stupid enough to challenge the god-like solar. True to his nature Namar often fights against the hordes of the abyss and legions of hell with unmatched zeal. 

Most beings would think that Namar is a big lumbering buffon but this is just another form of underestimation. Namar is as much a barbarian as savages are but he easily tempers his rage induced fights with the same level of wisdom other solars share. 

True to his name Namar constantly travels around the multiverse constantly trying out new types of food and will never turn down an offer of a meal, believing that anyone who wastes food is sinful and deserves to be bashed in. He would not do it though knowing his physical strength is enough to kill most mortals. 

Namar also prefers to not use weapons when fighting, believing that brute strength sometimes allow him the privilege of enduring some of the best fights. After all not everyone can admit to fist-fighting a balor and win.

But when times call for seriousness Namar will let go of all his jovial attitude and brings out his greatsword, Caladbolg. A sword too big to be called a sword, it might as well be called a giant hunk of metal. 

Swinging Caladbolg with divine strength, Namar cleaves through hordes of demons, armies of devils and legions of evil beings. 

Despite that, Namar is a very jolly being. Arrid takes extreme pleasure in his visits as the two share stories while eating food. The two kind solars are best friends but would rather fight alone as solars still believe that a solar that cannot stand alone is not a true solar. 

Namar also managed to break Velik's brooding attitude by inviting him to eat. Apparently the cold and edgy solar loves to eat ice cream, a delicacy available only to modern universes. 

Even the angel of death, Taciax, constantly dines with Namar once the legions of the undead have been quelled. But despite being a solar, Namar mostly deals with material plane problems. He tends to think that the multiverse in general is already full of dangers. 

One example of his dangerous escapades was when he fought a great red wyrm. A being on the top of the foodchain. A dragon at this age would destroy demigods and lesser gods but the gluttonous solar defeated it with both strength and skill. Mostly strength since Namar usually enters a rage when destroying his enemies. 

It is not rare for a famous restaurant to see a handsome young man in his early twenties order a large serving of everything they have then watching the man devour all of it with the same level of zeal when destroying evil enemies. 

If it not were for his nature as a solar, Namar would probably take other titles such as the World Champion of Hot-Dog-Eating, or the Pig Slayer or some of his even more ridiculous titles like Devourer of Sustenance. 

And something that most solars admit is that they are quite envious of Namar. Namar understands what it means to be alive and only so few of the 24 solars understand what it means. 

\columnbreak

### Namar's Field of Judgement
Despite the guess of some beings, Namar's field isn't connected to food. His field is connected to how much collateral something can affect people. If a large hoard of demons or devils attacked a city Namar is allowed to manifest his field so that he can protect everyone while slaughtering demons. His requirements are as follows. First he must be protecting a large amount of people or at least essential people to the realm. The second requirement is that his enemy or enemies are capable of defeating him. The last requirement is that he must be in a rage. When all requirements are met Namar can activate his field filling a 1000 mile radius area with his divine energy for 100 years. Namar's CR increases to 34 (240,000 XP) inside his field. 

Once in his field Namar gains the following bonuses:
- Namar is constantly in rage mode when inside his field. 
- Namar's damage bonus from his rage is doubled. 
- Namar can roll three additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. 
- When Namar's hit point is 1 his crit range becomes 16-20.
- Namar's walking speed increased by 50 feet.
- Namar can use the *Relentless Rage* feature of the barbarian but instead of adding 5 per successful save it only adds 3 per successful save.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Namar can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Namar releases his barbarian like energy fused with his divine energy in a 50-foot radius around him. Each creature affected must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) radiant damage, be frightened for 1 minute and knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage, not be frightened and knocked prone on a succesful one. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature becomes immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. 
- The ground splits open in a 50 feet radius area within 200 feet of Namar. The area is considered difficult terrain. Each creature must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or fall and be swallowed by the ground. They are considered restrained (escape DC 22) and prone. They take 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of their turn until they succeed.
- Namar uses his divine energy to close his wounds and heal him for 45 (10d8) hit points. This lair action cannot be used again for the next 2 rounds.

## Aziraphale "The Warden" 
##### "Power is not a means, it is an end. - Aziraphale"
Muted in color and almost devoid of emotion, Aziraphale eternally watches the multiverse guiding the race of men from his golden throne. Like his other siblings Aziraphale was born not from gods but from the positive planes' manifestation. Like all his siblings Aziraphale was an empty being at first, ready to be filled with the knowledge of how to efficiently protect the multiverse.

While solars had their own form of self-education, like Arrid who felt the warm touch of mortals, and Namar who found happiness in eating, Aziraphale found himself reading law books. Spending his early years in immersing himself in knowledge Aziraphale lacked the social capabilities of the other solars to the point that his viewpoint of good became slightly blurred.

Lacking the gray area that some solars had Aziraphale went to look for the gods. Safe in the knowledge that the benevolent gods would guide him properly. 

But what he failed to know at the time was that solars are the most premium of servants the gods would ever hope to want. 

A powerful pantheon of gods saw fit to have Aziraphale as their servant. Aziraphale knew that by accepting he would be able to protect the multiverse even better. The only problem was who the god Aziraphale pledges himself to would be. It is common knowledge that if a solar pledge itself to a god, the god must give something of equal value. 

The gods did not want to give a large portion of their power to Aziraphale in fear of the already powerful solar, so instead they all created a gift for him. 

Created from the mixed divine essence of the gods, a divine fiery blade, named Dyrnwyn, was bequeathed onto Aziraphale, a symbol of his station as the ultimate guardian and watcher of the universe. 

As the eons passed Aziraphale tried to learn the meaning of good by properly protecting the multiverse. But as time went by and eons became meaningless Aziraphale's meaning of good became a linear vision. What could have been a beautiful vision of the universe became a colorless and bland room. 

Even the stoic Velik is more flexible than Aziraphale. What was once an open book became a cold-unfeeling robot that only exists to separate bad from good. Some would even argue that Aziraphale is an empty shell that the gods employ.

But his siblings now know better because of that, the unpledged solars refuse to find their own gods while the ones who have already pledged themselves are being more careful. 

Aziraphale resides in a heavenly realm built by the gods he serves. Sitting atop his golden throne, Aziraphale directs his angels with unparalleled efficieny. When in need of agents other than angels Aziraphale makes pacts with warlocks and every once in a while he bestows clerical powers to mortals that revere and believe in his rule. 

Despite his long time in ruling over his realm and overseeing the protection of the multiverse, Aziraphale's skill in combat has not waned. In his free time Aziraphale practices the usage of his abilities and would hone his skills for the time that his angels are not enough to deal with a threat. 

Should a time when Aziraphale is required to enter the battle come, he brandishes his flaming sword and enters with a zeal only familiar to solars. His divine figures inspires strength to all who see him but only fear to those who would dare battle him in combat. 

Merciless in combat Aziraphale charges with methodical preciseness that would surprise the most cunning of devils and divine strength that overpowers even the strongest demons.

### Aziraphale's Field of Judgement
Unlike the other solar's field Aziraphale's field is connected to his divine realm. His requirement is extremely simple. Should a time when Aziraphale is required to enter the battle come, he opens a rift connecting his divine realm to any plane, in which he requires his true power. Unfortunately because of the gods refusal on fusing with his powers Aziraphale doesn't have any notable abilities connected to his field but his divine weapons gifted to him are strengthened to better serve him. Once his field is connected he fills a 1000 mile radius area with his divine energy changing it to better suit his abilities. The field will stay for 100 years before it dissipates. Aziraphale's CR increases to 32 (195,000 XP) in his field.

Once in his field Aziraphale gains the following bonuses:
- Aziraphale can cast the spell *Antipathy/Sympathy*, using his spell DC, as an at will spell. 
- Aziraphale manifests his sword's true power. Every damage coming from the sword ignores resistance and immunity.  
- Aziraphale's resistance to radiant damage becomes immunity.

## Lair Actions 
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Aziraphale can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Aziraphale can activate his shield to completely negate all damage from the next three times he would get damaged until he uses another lair action. 
- Aziraphale can summon up to two angels that have the same or lower CR as a deva or one angel that has the same CR or lower as a planetar. The summoned angels are not dismissed if Aziraphale uses this lair action again. Aziraphale cannot use this lair action for the next 3 rounds. 
- Aziraphale's vision is filled with the heaviness of pure judgement. Any mortal that Aziraphale can see must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. This has no effect if the creature already had 5 levels of exhaustion. A creature that succeeds is immune to this effect for 24 hours but will not remove their current exhaustion.

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Aziraphale is warped by his warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- People's emotions are easily quelled and the temptation to do sin is suppressed. 
- Corrupt and already sinful people will be influenced to repent and do anything to try and regain the purity. 
- People that are using magic to stave this effects will recieve constant nightmares and must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or take 5d10 psychic damage for not repenting.

## Adithar "The Soul-Seeker" 
##### "The soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone. - Adithar" 

The souls of the powerful, the souls of the kind, the souls of the gentle; all of these are what Adithar cares most about. To see the kind become evil, to see heroes live long enough to be villains, and to see the merciful succumb is the most abhorrent things that Adithar can see. 

Just like his brothers Adithar abhor evil in any way possible, but what Adithar truly despises is the corruption of the soul. Believing that souls are the purest of form any creature can have Adithar goes beyond to protect the souls of mortals from the clutches of devils, demons, and any creature that would dare to dirty a soul. 

When one of their brothers was destroyed because he became corrupted Adithar saw clearly, that even demons can be changed into good. And this notion was enforced when he met Phryix, the nascent demon lord that Arrid managed to change into good. With renewed vigor, Adithar travelled the multiverse in search of powerful demons and devils to see if they were capable of change. 

To his despair Adithar barely found any. The only evil beings he could convert were the weaker ones. So he had to destroy the strong ones permanently. He almost lost hope until he found one. A powerful devil, a devil so powerful he was a candidate for becoming an arch-devil, should Asmodeus wish it. 

For the first time Adithar saw light in the black soul of the devil, and ironically it came from someone so powerful. Just like Arrid, Adithar kept the powerful devil in an unbreakable prison. 

Sadly his efforts were in vain. Just because something could be saved, does not mean you should drown yourself for it. But the solar stayed optimistic. He did everything he could from simple chatting to forceful magical conversion. 

The change was not easy, for the first decades it had no effect against the devil except maybe making him more rude and vulgar. Until one day the devil forgot to greet him rudely like he did everyday. The devil noticed his mistep and started to speak rudely again but Adithar would not have missed it for the world and started to strengthen his devil rehabilitation. 

His persistant and rigourous way of dealing with the devil attracted the attention of not just the solars but almost every cosmic being. Adithar allowed his brothers to watch him but because of Aziraphale he disallowed the gods and other beings to interfere. The gods, primordials, and even far realm beings watched with earnest as they saw Adithar slowly change the devil. 

In truth, what Arrid did was a miracle but if one thinks about it, it was not impossible because Phryix was just becoming a demon lord. Unlike Adithar who was dealing with a powerful devil. But eons passed and the progress was minimal and the gods who were always waging a war lost interest, the primordials just stopped caring, and the eldritch beings of the far realm decided to do their own experiments. 

The only ones who stayed to watch were the solars, given that they were not occupied with other important things to do such as saving the universe from another powerful threat. 

If there was one god who stayed to watch it was the powerful deity Bahamut. Arguably the most benevolent of all the gods, Bahamut took great interest in Adithar's endeavor and gave his support. 

Even when the project took a little longer than expected, Bahamut kept helping until eventually Adithar allowed him in along with his brothers. 

It took milleniums, something so impossibly long and most would think it's no longer worth it. The only ones who stayed to watch were other solars, given that they weren't occupied with other important things to do such as saving the universe from another powerful threat. Only Bahamut kept Adithar's positive outlook. 

Until one day the devil said, "Let's stop, this is not worth your time and it isn't worth mine. Every plan of escaping was foiled and brute force would not win me anything." For a moment the solar and god saw through the devil's soul, it never changed. The small spark of light was the same as it was years ago. 

Dejected, Adithar simply let the devil go to the surprise of every solar. All of them called him out in his stupidity except Bahamut and Arrid. Arrid knew what it meant to fail and Bahamut simply believed that Adithar would do the right choice. 

The devil left and was never seen again. But what the devil did not notice is that Bahamut and Adithar placed a fail-safe into him should the devil do evil. 

When the solars heard of this they left but not before apologizing to Adithar. Adithar waited for the devil to do evil acts. The seal would immediately teleport the devil to his field but surprisingly it never happened.

Curious they spied on the devil only to see him in hell resting. The devil spent his days coming up with evil plans on dominating the world and taking over hell but each time a plan was almost complete he would stop and scrap it. Adithar and Bahamut kept watching this until the devil one day slammed his throne with pure rage. 

Tears made out of foul ichor and blood fell from the devil's eyes as his face contorted in complete pain of his being. Adithar and Bahamut smiled and retrieved him without delay. The battle to take him was fierce but in the end they succeeded. 

When they got out of the Nine Hells they returned to Bahamut's home. Despite the possibility of death the devil did not fear anything as he looked blankly far-off into the distance. 

Adithar was looking at the devil's soul, only to see a small black portion being devoured by the light. 

Adithar asked the devil if he wanted to change. The devil looked at the solar with dead eyes and nodded mechanically. Adithar knew that he could not keep a devil under him even if it was changed especially since he had his responsibilities. 

So he entrusted the devil to Bahamut. Bahamut immediately accepted and let the devil bathe in the immense divine waters of Mount Celestia. 

It did not take long but the devil changed, if he could still be called a devil. Something akin to an angel, it and any following devils that might change became, the Redeemed. With a silver-like body and golden wings, the Redeemed became servants of light that followed Bahamut but most of all followed Adithar.

A few years later the solars who stayed unpledged were surprised to hear that their brother Adithar pledged himself to Bahamut as his right hand. Although if one looks at the facts it was inevitable.

\pagebreakNum 

### Adithar's Field of Judgement 
Most beings would believe that Adithar's field is paradise and they are correct. While some solars, namely Ragani and Clarion, have fields that devastate continents, Adithar's field by contrast is a paradise. Worlds visited by Adithar's field take pride and complete reverence in the fact that the solar visited them. 

For a world to be submerged in Adithar's field is nothing short of a miraculous gift that not even the gods can give. Wild animals become more peaceful, crops grow at three times the speed and barely use any nutrients of the soil, people become calmer and even evil people start to lose their horrible temperament. 

Adithar's field is already a paradise but when his powers are fused with the domain of Bahamut, his paradise-like field became something akin to an outer plane resembling those in the upper planes. 

Sometimes Elysium would fail to compare to the beauty and brightness of Adithar's field. But one should not underestimate this solar's ability to destroy evil. Unknown to most, that kind solar, Adithar, is the 3rd strongest, only below his absurdly strong sibling, Taciax and his impossibly powerful eldest, Xephalam.

Like Taciax, Adithar pledged himself to Bahamut because of the large boost to his power he would get but unlike Taciax, Adithar's choice was also partly because of his emotions. He felt that if he were to choose any god to pledge his loyalty to it would be Bahamut himself. 

Adithar's requirements are only two. The first requirement is that his enemy must have at least taken one soul indirectly or directly in their whole existence. They cannot hide this fact from Adithar no matter the means. The second requirement is that his opponent should be capable of defeating him and can influence thousands of evil souls. Once Adithar activates his field, a 1000 mile radius becomes filled with his divine energy that dissipates over the the course of 100 years. Forests become extremely healthy, crops grow three times faster while using minimal nutrients, people live twice as long and become immune to diseases while descendants of people that lives here will forever be touched by the divine and will become resistant to radiant and necrotic damage. 

Due to the extremely powerful nature of Adithar's powers instead of gaining bonuses when he is in the field Adithar instead gets a different statblock.

> ##### Adithar "The Soul God"
> If Adithar uses his field and transforms, his health is refilled to max and every spell he has cast is also refreshed. Use his second stat block. Once Adithar uses his field form his CR increases to 37 (315,000 XP).

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Adithar can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Adithar summons the soul of a godly mage long past that he saved and causes him to cast an 8th-level *disintegrate* spell on a target. The target must succeed on a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 96 (16d6+40) force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.  
- Adithar summons the souls of 2 legendary warriors long past that he saved and asks them to fight for him. Each warrior has Statistics equivalent to a Planetar, except that they are considered medium humanoids . Use a planetar or any CR 16 medium humanoid. This lair action cannot be used again for the next 2 rounds.
- Adithar calls the legendary dragon god Bahamut for aid and opens a portal for him. Bahamut's head goes through the portal and he releases his powerful breath of complete and utter disintegration in a 200-foot cone in front of him. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 27 Constitution saving throw, taking 157 (15d20) force damage and be stunned for 1 minute on a failed save, or take half as much damage and not be stunned on a succesful one. Creatures that die this way turn to dust. Adithar can only use this ability once when he is below half health and only once a day. 

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Adithar is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Souls, whether good or evil cannot be forcefully taken by anyone. 
- Good beings that die are always under the effects of the spell *gentle repose*. 
- Forests become healthier, people are immune to disease, live longer, and in general life becomes better in every way possible.
- Any beings that have taken souls whether indirectly or directly are always under the effects of the spell *forbiddance* while inside Adithar's field.

## Adithar "The Soul God"
##### “What is better? to be born good or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?”
There was a legend that the most powerful solars rarely used their fields believing that there normal state was enough. There were four of them, four solars that even gods would rather not meet even if it meant befriending them.

Adithar is one of them, he is the third strongest solar below the powerful Taciax and the almighty Xephalam.

Each creature in a 300-foot radius around him must succeed on a DC 32 Charisma saving throw, taking 117 (18d12) force damage plus 19 (3d12) force damage for every soul he released, or half as much damage on a successful one. This ignores resistance and treats immunity as resistance. On a failed save if they are a humanoid they also have their soul exchanged with another affected humanoid that failed its saving throw for the next 24 hours. If only one creature failed the saving throw the exchange has no effect. They switch their Statistics with the other creature while they are in the other body. Additionally while they are in the other body they have disadvantage on all their Dexterity and Strength ability checks and attack rolls as they are not used to the other body. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If at the end of the duration the humanoid returns to a dead body or if there is no body to return anymore, the affected humanoid dies. Adithar cannot benefit from the effects of Soul Borrow and cannot store souls in his Infinity box for the next 24 hours. Released souls go to their respective realms, unless they recently died, in which case they linger around their dead body.

## Caelum "The Sun Emperor" 
##### "After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. - Caelum" 

Cheerful and generally jolly, Caelum travels the multiverse with a smile on his face. Some say that Pelor's brightness pales in comparison to the brightness that Caelum emanates when he smiled. While some solars like Arrid and Adithar are examples of kind natured beings, Caelum is the greatest example of a Solar that knows how to be alive and knows how to be happy. 

One of the solars that knows true happiness, Caelum travels the multiverse spreading happiness and smiting evil. And unlike most of the solars, Caelum does not mind fighting alongside others and wouldn't second think to apologize 

He charges in battle with a huge mace filled with his divine energy fused with the power of the bright sun. 

Despite the comparison people make with Caelum and Pelor, it is a known fact in the outer planes that Caelum serves the sun god himself. 

Caelum met the famous deity when he was travelling and noticed that both of them have the same ideals. And because of this, the two super powerful beings constantly met to chat. Something that both of them treasured. Caelum usually told stories of depressed mortals that he constantly visited to help. 

It was something that was a little unknown to the Sun God but basically Caelum explained that some people are evil because of how their mind works. Caelum believed that even the most inherently kindest beings could turn evil if they faced something horrible enough to change them. 

Caelum warned Pelor that even the unchangeable Solars where subject to this phenomenon. The very notion that solars are corruptible is blasphemy but the solars know this very well, for they lost a brother through corruption. 

After a long time of mourning eventually Caelum started to cheer himself up, safe in the knowledge that their deceased brother would never want them to be this saddened.

It started with a simple smile, and in truth it was a fake smile but eventually it became something of a routine. Until one day he realized he was happy. He prayed for his brother not towards any gods but simply prayed that his brother will never be looked upon as a horrible being by anyone. 

His form was said to be like the blinding sun. He believes that Pelor is a truly benevolent deity, when asked what type of person Pelor is he will respond "The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father! If only I could be so grossly incandescent!" 

True to his title Caelum wears a golden armor with a beautiful insignia of Pelor attached to it. His wings are golden with streaks of bright orange and burn with hot radiant fire.

Just like his siblings Caelum is both a sign of glory and a symbol of battle once he enters the fray. It is said that armies of demons and legions of devils shy away at the mere presence of a solar, Caelum is no different. 

He charges into battle with his war mace in one hand and his divine shield in the other.

### Caelum's Field of Judgement
Caelum's field is a place of extreme jolliness and upbeat energy, the good are happy and jolly but the same is not true for any evil. The sun rises and releases beams of holy energy bathing the good and harming the evil. His requirements are just like his brothers. First, Caelum must be facing a powerful entity capable of defeating him if he holds back. Lastly, Caelum must make sure that his field cannot hurt other people unless those people are evil. Once the requirements are met Caelum can set his field increasing his power. A 1000 mile radius area would be filled with his divine domain infused energy influencing the people and materials existing there for 100 years. Caelum's CR increases to 33 (215,000 XP) inside his field. 

Once inside his field Caelum gains the following bonuses:
- Each creature that can see Caelum at the start of its turn must succeed on a DC 27 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. If a creature succeeds the saving throw they are immune to this effect for 1 hour.
- Caelum's attacks causes enemies to be blinded. Every time Caelum hits a creature with a weapon attack it must succeed on a DC 27 Constitution throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. 
- Every time Caelum deals radiant damage to a creature he heals for 5 hit points. Area of effect abilities and spells heal him for every creature damaged by them. Every time Caelum uses his supernova ability he heals for 100 hit points. 

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Caelum can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Caelum calls down a concentrated sunbeam in a 60-foot radius on a point he chooses within 200 feet of him. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 14 (4d6) radiant damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage and is stunned for 1 minute on a failed save or half as much damage and is not stunned on a successful one. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
- Caelum slashes out with sun energy with his hand in front of him. All creatures in a 15-foot cone in front of Caelum must succeed on a Dexterity 24 saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) radiant damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage and is ignited. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 11 (2d10) fire damage and 11 (2d10) radiant damage at the start of each of its turns.
- Caelum points his finger in a direction he chooses and fires a beam of pure dense concentrated sun energy that fires along a straight line up to 1000 feet in a direction Caelum chooses, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface or a creature. If the beam would strike a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the beam strikes the target and stops. When the beam strikes something the target takes 35 (10d6) radiant damage and 35 (10d6) fire damage that goes through resistance and treats immunity as resistance. He cannot use it again for the next 2 rounds. 

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Caelum is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Days last longer by 2 more hours and the nights are unusually bright. 
- Wounds heal faster where light wounds are basically scratches while mortal wounds become light wounds.
- Darkness and shadows, magical or not are always weakened.
- Healing from any source is maximized for celestial creatures while they are resting.

## Tystra "The Moon Empress"
##### “The moon is a loyal companion. It never leaves. It’s always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day it’s a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and waning, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be mortal. Uncertain. Alone. Cratered by imperfections. - Tystra”

A deep thinker and very melancholic, Tystra is the pure opposite of her sibling, Caelum. It is common knowledge for mortals that the solars are all male but this untrue. Out of the 24 solars 4 of them are female and for what reason they were made, it is still unknown. Tystra was the first female of the five female solars that were made, because of this she questioned her existence the most leading to her current attitude.

Though eventually she stopped questioning herself and instead tried to find meaning in her existence so that she could find the most optimal way of helping others in her own way. 

But it took a lot out of her, she found herself questioning her existence more and more. What was the point of her being female. Would it have been any different if she was male like all her other brothers. 

But nevertheless Tystra did her best to protect those who were oppressed and save those who were abused. Despite her questions, Tystra was still a solar. 

She was still the shining moonlight that banished the darkness, the indomitable strength of the heavens when hell needs to be pushed back. 

Tystra donned the mantle of the moon empress, something she thought was very fitting once she became close friends with Caelum. She thought that her brother would shun her but nothing of the sort was present from the shining and bright solar. She believed that she was good in her own way and decided not to change nor question herself.

But her personality was already set and she became a quiet and melancholic deep thinker though no longer accompanied by the deep sadness she used to have. 

During her journeys Tystra met Selûne, the moon goddess. Due to her attitude Tystra simply made small talk with the goddess. And surprisngly for her she made an acquaintance. It would have been cliche if Tystra pledged to Selûne because she became close friends with her like how Caelum and Pelor became close but they did. 

It was not long after, that Tystra pledged herself to the moon goddess and became her closest ally and closest friend, above her exarchs and more than her closest friends. 

Tystra disliked noisy affairs, despite her close friendship with Caelum. She especially disliked noisy and destructive villains, she makes sure that such enemies die quiet rather than die screaming. 

Caelum constantly visits Tystra for sibling bonding and because they are also very close, exhibiting a more close relation than the other solars. 

Wearing dark violet clothing paired with her luminescent deep blue colored hair, Tystra is the calm before the storm once she enters the battlefield. It is said that her enchanting bright violet eyes that glow in the dark are usually the last things evil beings see before they die. 

When in battle Tystra wields two moon-shaped blades. She dual-wields them and is extremely deadly in her own fighting style. Her graceful appearance and lack of intimidating presence makes her enemies go silent even when in the middle of combat. Her very presence silences the area. 

\columnbreak

### Tystra's Field of Judgement
Tystra's field of judgement is closely linked to the moon. Once she activates it a deep and beautiful full moon descends and covers the sky turning morning to night. Unlike Caelum's field which brightens the mood, Tystra's field dampens the mood and goes even further by inhibiting people's abilities to read others motive or hide motives. Her requirements are simple, her enemies must be capable of defeating her and it only acts as a last resort. Once the requirements are met, Tystra can activate her field increasing her power. A 1000 mile radius area would be filled with her divine domain infused energy influencing the people and environment existing there for 100 years. Tystra's CR increases to 31 (175,000 XP) inside her field. 

Once inside her field Tystra gains the following bonuses:

- Wherever Tystra moves, a 30-foot-radius cloud of magical darkness follows her. The cloud acts as a 5th level *darkness* spell. If dispelled it reforms itself after 3 turns.
- The reach of Tystra's melee weapon attacks increases to 20 feet. 
- When a creature is damaged by Tystra's weapon attacks its hit point maximum are magically reduced by the same amount. If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies. A creature's hit point maximum can be restored with the lesser restoration spell or similar magic. 

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Tystra can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Tystra calls a silvery beam of powerful pale moonlight that shines down in a 60-foot radius, 480-foot high cylinder centered on a point she can see. Creatures in the radius must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) force damage and be blinded on a failed save, or half as much damage and not be blinded on a successful one. 
- Tystra calls down a small meteor that hits in 100-foot radius centered on a point she can see. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) magical bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Tystra calls upon the solemn feeling of the moon. Each creature in a 300-foot radius around Tystra must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving or be magically charmed for 1 minute. The charmed creature regards Tystra as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target is not under Tystra's control, it takes Tystra's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Tystra is warped by her magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Nights last longer by 2 more hours and and the sun takes on a bluish tinge.
- Deep thinking results in inspirational ideas. Mechanical ideas and revolutionary ideas prosper really well in this domain.  
- All forms of regeneration or healing for fiends, aberrations, fey and elementals do not work.

## Viryn "The Good Mercenary"
##### "Tell me who is good, the one who saved many and few died or the one who saved many injured but no one died. In the end whether you do things the right way or another way as long as everyone is saved nothing else matters, when you're down from the casualties pick yourself up because not everyone was lucky enough to be saved. - Viryn"  

While all solars do good in the ways they can it does not mean they have no weakness. An example is the justice ridden solar Viryn. While he shows the exemplary form of justice that all solars have, Viryn has been called one of the more stupid solars. He is still a genius compared to normal beings but compared to solars Viryn is below average. 

Due to this, his way of fighting evil was quite unorthodox. Viryn did nothing but destroy evil creatures. While this might seem the generic job of solars, all solars find a way to help further the good things in life, which Viryn did not. To counter his weakness Viryn instead looked for a way to help others.

He became something akin to a mercenary but instead of money Viryn took favors in exchange for destroying evil creatures. When Viryn was in a world where a kingdom was threatened by a powerful evil mage, Viryn made an exchange. He would destroy the evil mage and in exchange the kingdom would help the poor and start removing crime and corruption.

While most beings would think this a stupid way since there is no form of assurance, Viryn found his own countermeasure. Viryn was proficient in using the spell *geas* and he found a way to use it permanently and on a large amount of people. When Viryn destroyed the evil mage he  activated the magic on the kingdom. The king who first planned on duping the angel was forced to comply. He turned to do things that helped the kingdom. 

A few years later the kingdom would be named Variaden and would be one of the few cities that would be called a utopia. This style of helping caused Viryn to be one of the most famous solars as it allowed actual long lasting changes. 

Kingdoms become dynasties, planets become utopias, life in general becomes better due to Viryn's philosopy and style of helping. If one has the ability to help others, do it, that is what Viryn always says. This style of helping has made Viryn the target of hundreds of tricks, but despite that he managed to foil every single one.

Devils are Viryn's most common enemy, for they all wish to corrupt him by using his philosophy to do evil things. Because of their aggressiveness to corrupt him, Viryn has made devils to be his most hated enemies. While charging in battle, he can charge with the same zeal as Namar or the same righteousness as Caelum. 

When Viryn charges he raises his greatsword as he blasts his enemies with his divine magic. Devils and alike tremble when the good mercenary takes a job.

Viryn tends to be an optimistic being, seeing as he likes spending time with Arrid, Namar, and Caelum. While Viryn is a very outgoing being he doesn't have any quarrels with Velik as the two hate devils with a passion, and Aziraphale and Viryn constantly does contracts when Aziraphale deems that his angels are not enough.

Wearing simple white clothing Viryn travels the multiverse and usually roams the planes near the material plane. His magical powers are just like Velik's and Arrid's, he refused to find other sources and instead uses his inherent skills to the maximum.

Viryn is also mostly known when he made a deal with the god of justice Tyr to escort an extremely important prisoner, to what the deal meant only the two knew.

### Viryn's Field of Judgement
Due to Viryn's lack of extra power, he can choose to activate his field at any time he chooses. Once activated people affected by his Geas are now unable to escape his field nor can they use any magical ways of leaving it. Viryn will also be able to sense wherever they are. Viryn can activate his field increasing his power. A 1000 mile radius area would be filled with his divine energy influencing the people and environment existing there for 100 years. Viryn's CR increases to 32 (195,000 XP) inside his field.

Once inside his field Viryn gains the following bonuses: 
- Viryn can use his reaction to make a dodge/disengage action. 
- When Viryn uses the spell *shield* the bonus to AC is doubled.	 
- Viryn can use a reaction to attack a creature within his range with any of his melee attacks.
- When Viryn would hit with a weapon attack he can double the damage from his Honed Angelic Weapons trait until the start of his next turn. Once he uses this trait 3 times it can't be used again until the next dawn. 

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Viryn can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Viryn generates a 30-foot radius magical field around him, protecting him and any number of creatures that he chooses. Each creature gains a +5 to their AC and a +5 to their saving throws while in this field. The field lasts until he uses another lair action or dies. 
- Viryn creates an extremely condensed magical field and throws it towards a creature within 300 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (9d10) bludgeoning damage and 33 (6d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
- Viryn slams his hand on the floor creating 10 walls that are 5 feet thick and 20 feet long. He can control where these walls appear and each wall functions the same as the spell wall of stone. Each wall has an AC of 20, and 100 hit points.

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Viryn is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Evil creatures that have natural armor have their AC reduced by 2. 
- Good-natured favors and deals are well respected and creatures making them are under the *geas* spell to keep them.
- Anybody that abuses the effects of the field must make a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the spell *geas* and will be forced to do good.

## Kamela "Paradigmatic Enchantress"
##### "Anyone with a good heart, is beautiful in their own way. - Kamela"
With a penchant for fashion and a talented mind, Kamela travels the multiverse bringing amazing fashion styles that surpasses all current and possibly all that will come fashion styles but every once in a while she also brings a good dose of solar-style world saving.

Similar to her super happy brother, Caelum, Kamela found her own calling in life, to design out-of-this-world fashion styles. 

Kamela travels the multiverse looking for inspiration everywhere. She would visit a famous dress shop in a bustling city, sometimes an old sewist but either way Kamela makes sure she finds an inspiration. It is not uncommon for Kamela to have connections with many mortals due to her constant wish of finding more inspiring events. 

And when she finds inspiration Kamela turns it into reality. Kamela also is very kind in nature, she seems to always find a topic to talk to with other people all the time and most of the time these people would not know that they are talking to a being like Kamela. They would think she is a rich noble due to her beautiful clothing.

She sometimes takes her time pretending to be mortal and live with the mortals she finds extremely interesting. It would not be a surprise to see Kamela in an actual relationship with another mortal. While solar's rarely have actual romantic relationships, as they believe it harms their ability to be unbiased protectors of all that is good, some of them actually pursue relationships with beings that are good and they find worthy. 

Other than Kamela only a select few solars are brave enough to take another partner, something which they all ask their eldest brother for permission first. As they must be prepared for the full responsibility of having a partner, especially when it comes to choosing to do what is right, even if it means the loss of a loved one.

Although Kamela has made thousands of friends and acquaintances but none of them is as close to her as her best friend, Redempta. A mortal of exquisite tastes and interesting hobbies, Redempta took Kamela's interest by storm and the two became fast friends.  

But due to her responsibilities, there were times Kamela would not come back for weeks and sometimes months which made Redempta melancholic. Eventually Kamela stopped coming, not because she no longer wanted to be with Redempta, it was because she would no longer be able to do her job as a solar otherwise, so she left but vowed to come back. 

It took years before Kamela was able to visit Redempta again and when she did it was not a laughing matter anymore. The next time Kamela came back, she could no longer find Redempta. 

Worried for her friend Kamela looked around and found out that her best friend has long since passed. Unbeknownst to her Redempta was cursed when Kamela disappeared. It seems she tried her best to look for her missing friend Kamela but it ended with her dying.

Heartbroken and grieving Kamela lost her spark and she started to wander the world saving others as she would always do. She would have become like her brother, Velik, if she continued being like this.

It was when she visited her eldest brother that she was refreshed. Her eldest brother, Xephalam owns a beautiful realm filled with divine flowers that he has cultivated. He sometimes takes his siblings there to meditate or reflect on their current actions. She managed to resume her old attitude and promised to take responsibility for the mortals that she would take in lest what happened to Redempta occurs again.

### Kamela's Field of Judgement
Kamela's field is something she created due to an inspired moment. Her field of judgement is a giant net that captures her opponents and prevents escape. And unlike most solars, Kamela can easily activate her field due to it's non combat nature. Her field is mostly utility and simply allows Kamela better control over the field. Kamela can activate her field increasing her power. A 1000 mile radius area would be filled with her divine energy influencing the people and environment existing there for 100 years. Kamela's CR increases to 29 (135,000 XP) inside her field.

Once inside her field Kamela gains the following bonuses:
- When Kamela uses the *entangle* spell she does not have have to hold concentration on it and it only disappears when her field disappears.
- Kamela is also always under the effect of the spell *spider climb*. 
- Kamela is also always under the effect of the spell *freedom of movement*.
- Kamela's walking speed increases by 100 feet.
- Kamela's AC increases to 21.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Kamela can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Kamela activates her field's net-like properties. Each creature of her choosing in a 300-foot radius around her must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be moved up to 60 feet away from their current position to an unoccupied space of Kamela's choice. 
- Kamela activates her field's net-like properties and each creature of her choosing must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and be restrained for 1 minute. A restrained creature takes 27 (6d8) slashing damage at the start of its turn. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 17 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. 
- The strings of the field vibrate strongly in a 100-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that Kamela can see within 500 feet of her. The 100-foot radius area is under the effects of the spell *earthquake* (DC 22) until she uses another lair action.
 

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Kamela is warped by her magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Invisible strings are everywhere inside a 1000 mile radius area around her which act like signals for Kamela.
- The strings react strongly at the presence of powerful evil creatures or dangerous events.
- The strings allow Kamela to have near limitless vision inside her area.

## Kaiyoqua "The Wings of the True Seas"
##### “We know only too well that what we are doing is nothing more than a drop in the ocean. But if the drop were not there, the ocean would be missing something. - Kaiyoqua”

When Ragani first mastered the flames of the primordials, three other solars followed his example even though their eldest brother advised against it. Kaiyoqua, went to the Elemental Chaos and entered the Elemental Plane of Water. 

At first, just like Ragani, Kaiyoqua befriended the elementals, which took a while, but eventually he gained their trust and in turn managed to convert many of them into good elementals. 

Slowly he learned to control the elemental water with the help of the water primordials. In no time at all, Kaiyoqua mastered the control of the element and became either just as strong or stronger than his brother, Ragani. 

When he finished his training, Kaiyoqua travelled the multiverse to make his mark, just like all his other siblings. 

Kaiyoqua found himself wanting. Seeking for more strength Kaiyoqua found himself destroying evil water elementals, dragon turtles and even ancient krakens. Each time he destroyed one he would strengthen himself by absorbing their essences. 

But even if he was a being as good and as kind as a solar, Kaiyoqua found himself on the edge of corruption. The taste of power drove Kaiyoqua to destroy evil with an extreme passion and a slight tinge of gluttony. 

It was at this point when Kaiyoqua found himself alone, all of his powerful enemies either long destroyed or gone into hiding, that he thirsted for more power. Kaiyoqua then started to search out even the weaker evil creatures but he found them lacking.

It did not take him long to realize that not only evil creatures can harbor powerful essences, but so can good creatures. 

Kaiyoqua started hunting powerful creatures, good or bad, and started absorbing more and more of their essences to make himself more powerful. It was when he was about to strike down a devout paladin, that his vision suddenly cleared as if a magical haze covering him had disappeared. 

In his shame, he healed the wounded paladin and left. When he gated away he found himself in the realm of his eldest brother, Xephalam.

Burning with shame he walked up to his eldest brother, who was in his garden drinking tea while resting in a cozy gazebo. Approaching him, Kaiyoqua noticed that despite all the power he had absorbed he was nothing but a speck compared to his brother. 

When he asked if it was his brother that saved him, Xephalam affirmed his suspicion. He asked for the reason and the eldest answered that he did not want to kill another sibling.  

Kaiyoqua did not ask anything else and sat in the gazebo to meditate. Eventually his elder brother left him alone to reflect. 

After a while he realized his mistake and decided to change. 

He came out of his brother's realm fully realized and changed. Now with his sight set on the right path again, Kaiyoqua charges forward to defeat evil with the strength of the elements.

### Kaiyoqua's Field of Judgement
Kaiyoqua's field of judgement is any location inhabited by an extremely powerful evil capable of upturning the balance of a plane. He must first deem an opponent evil and powerful enough to warrant activating his field. Because once he uses his field a 1000 mile radius would be flooded by the elemental waters he calls his powers, leaving it as a flooded sea for 100 years. Kaiyoqua's CR increases to 28 (120,000 XP) inside his field.

Once in his field Kayoiqua gains the following bonuses:
- Kaiyoqua gains the *water form* trait. He can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. He can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. 
- Kaiyoqua's swim speed is increased by 100 feet.
- Kaiyoqua's water based attacks, abilities and spells ignore bludgeoning resistance and treat immunity as resistance.
- Kaiyoqua's attacks, abilities and spells that deal cold damage ignore cold resistance and treat immunity as resistance.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Kaiyoqua can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Kaiyoqua controls the sea that his field creates and creates a powerful huge vortex in a 1000-foot radius around him. All creatures within the vortex must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet closer towards him. The area is considered difficult terrain, and creatures must succeed on DC 22 Strength saving throw to swim away or take an action to move away. If they fail their saving throw they will instead be pulled 30 feet closer towards him. While in the vortex, creatures that fail their saving throws take 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage plus 35 (10d6) cold damage every round and creatures that succeed their saving throws take half damage. Creatures within 100 feet of Kaiyoqua take double damage from the vortex. This ability takes a lot of concentration, and Kaiyoqua cannot act or move while doing this lair action. If Kaiyoqua takes 200 damage in one round he loses concentration and the vortex dissipates. This lair action cannot be used again for 4 rounds after Kaiyoqua has lost his concentration.
- Kaiyoqua freezes an area of water of any size between a 5-foot to a 100-foot square centered on a point Kaiyoqua can see turning it into solid ground. He can also melt any ice he made. The ground is considered difficult terrain for creatures that do not have cold resistance. Creatures who do not have cold resistance must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw at the start of their turn while they stand on the ice or fall prone. 
- Pressurized water spears burst out of the sea hitting all the creatures of Kaiyoqua's choice in a 50-foot radius around him. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 31 (7d8) piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. 

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Kaiyoqua is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Healing from any source is maximized for water-based creatures while they are resting.
- Fire cannot last in this area and dies quickly. The temperature also goes down to near freezing.
- Sea-life that lives in this field is more fresh and naturally healthier.

## Zadacrel "The Prayer of a Thousand" 
##### "Prayer is not asking. It is a longing of the soul. It is daily admission of one's weakness. It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart. - Zadacrel" 

When the gods fail their responsibility to take care of the mortals that need them, a small sincere prayer that invokes Zadacrel's name is all it takes for his magic to save them. 

When the gods first took responsibility for the welfare and survival of most mortals, other powerful beings such as Zadacrel took offence to this as a lot of them believed no one had the right to decide over the mortals, especially considering that they have their own free will. 

But the will of the gods was overwhelming and their numbers forced the other powerful beings to back down. Eventually almost all the mortals were under some form of religion or cult that revered the gods. 

At first it went well, the gods properly took care of their followers but eventually the population of the mortals spiraled out of control and the gods could not take care of them all. This angered the benevolent beings that did not agree with the god's desire to take in and control the mortals. 

One of these powerful beings was the extremely benevolent Zadacrel. Despite his anger, the gods did not change and he decided to take it in his own hands. 

But he himself was not a god and he could not give give clerical power to the mortals, unless it is by a pact, something akin to a warlock and a patron. While he could have done that to every mortal he met, it would have caused total chaos and the mortals might have abused his power. 

And ascending to godhood was out of the question, while very easy for someone of his power, his eldest brother would be disappointed, something all the solars are afraid of. 

So instead of becoming something he disapproves, he created something that no other creature could possibly make. A powerful blessing that affected the whole multiverse. With the help of his eldest brother, Zadacrel created a ritual that encompassed an entire plane. A spell that surpassed anything ever created. 

This spell, was not offensive nor did it protect people from evil. Instead it was a powerful response that invoked the powers of Zadacrel, when people sincerely prayed and asked for his guidance and help. 

The gods scoffed at this and said their followers would never betray them, since the spell itself had requirements for a mortal to be able to invoke it. The first requirement was that one must be mortal, secondly they must be willing to forsake their gods, thirdly they must be both good and benevolent, and lastly the prayer must be sincere, something said at one's most desperate moments in their lives. 

Despite the insane amount of power this spell has, mortals can only invoke this prayer twice within their lives and invoking it a third time kills the mortal but fortunately if they lived a good life and were benevolent, they have the choice to be reincarnated or if they were heroes, they can take the choice of living in the realm of Xephalam, the strongest celestial in existence. 

This made the good gods hate Zadacrel, but due to Xephalam, none of them could do anything to him or harm him. So like Zadacrel, the gods grit their teeth in anger.

Full of compassion and mercy for the downtrodden, Zadacrel holds the line against the vicious, the evil and those that wish to harm others.

### Zadacrel's Field of Judgement
When the people look for a savior, a messiah, or simply someone to put their hopes and prayers on, Zadacrel gladly activates his powerful field to do combat with the powerful and immense creatures that he faces almost everyday. Zadacrel's field is something akin to a temple, peaceful and reverent. Good mortals are safe in this place and evil creatures are weakened. Once he uses his field, a 1000 mile radius would be filled with his divine energy and transformed into a peaceful temple-like area for 100 years. Zadacrel's CR increases to 33 (215,000 XP) inside his field. 

Once in his field Zadacrel gains the following bonuses:
- Zadacrel is always under the effects of the spell *sanctuary.*  
- Zadacrel's AC increases to 26.
- Zadacrel's Sacred Prayer ability's healing is maximized.

## Lair Acitons
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Zadacrel can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Zadacrel goes quiet and prays for himself and those that he wishes to save. Each creature within a 100-foot radius around him must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by him. A creature charmed by Zadacrel's ability will not do anything harmful to Zadacrel or any other good mortal. Each time a charmed creature takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the effect ends. 
- Zadacrel creates a spherical, powerful barrier that ranges from between a 5-foot to 100-foot radius around him. The barrier acts as a *wall of force*. The barrier lasts as long as Zadacrel wants unless he dismisses it, uses it again or until he loses his concentration (as if he was concentrating on a spell). He can concentrate on the barrier in addition to his other spells. He makes a separate Constitution saving throw for it, every time he is damaged. 
- Zadacrel releases a burst of powerful divine energy around a 100-foot radius around him. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) radiant damage, be knocked prone and have their speed reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and not be knocked prone and have their speed reduced to 0 on a successful one. 

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Zadacrel is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Good aligned creatures gain a shield that has 10 hit points and will block any form of damage for them unless destroyed. Once destroyed the shield regenerates at dawn. 
- Evil aligned creatures lose their magic resistance, if they have the trait and their attacks will always deal half damage, that can further be reduced by resistances.
- Any form of violence or evil act will be reduced and naturally inhibited. Neutral creatures have the tendency to do good, while evil creatures have the tendency not to do evil.

### True Magic: Prayer
When Zadacrel earned the faith of countless worlds he understood the deepness and importance of prayer to fill others with hope thus he learned the concept of prayer. The reason why Zadacrel learned True Magic through prayer, is because unlike the gods, Zadacrel provided safety through prayers without any reward to him whatsoever. Eventually with proper power control and manipulation, Zadacrel learned the mastery of True Magic: Prayer. **This is a Variant of Zadacrel.**

His True Magic DC is **32**.
___
___
Due to his mastery of True Magic: Prayer, Zadacrel gains the following bonuses:

##### Body Concept
- **Messiah.** When creatures see Zadacrel they must succeed on a DC 32 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by him on a failed save, or be immune to this effect for 1 minute on a success. Creatures, that are naturally immune to being charmed or have magical items that prevent it, are affected. Creatures that are charmed consider Zadacrel as the deity that will deliver them from all their sufferings and will do everything in their power to protect and serve him even if it means dying for him. In addition, this charming effect lasts forever. These effects can only be removed by a 10th level *wish* spell. Additionally a creature can repeat the saving throws once per year, ending the effects on a success. Zadacrel also regains 100 hit points at the start of his turns.

##### Reality Concept
- ***Deus Vult.*** Zadacrel calls upon the will of all that put their faith on him and he touches one creature of his choosing. That creature must succeed on a DC 32 Charisma saving throw. or be erased from existence on a failed saving throw, or take 500 radiant damage that ignores resistance and immunity on a successful one. A creature that dies by this ability cannot be restored to life in any way, except for an 11th level *true resurrection* spell or 11th level *wish*. A creature that succeeds on their saving throw and survives the damage dealt becomes immune to this ability for 1 hour. 

##### Will Concept
- ***Miracle.*** Zadacrel prays to create one of many powerful and miraculous effects. These effects include:
	- Zadacrel creates one object of up to 100,000 gp in value that is not a magical item or create one object of up to 25,000 in value that is magical. The object can be no more than 10,000 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space he can see.
    - Zadacrel allows up to one hundred creatures that he can see to regain all their hit points, and he ends all effects on them described in the *greater restoration* and *remove curse* spell.
    - Zadacrel grants up to ten creatures that he can see Resistance to 1 damage type he chooses.
    - Zadacrel grants to one creature he can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect forever. He can only grant one form of immunity to a creature, granting a new immunity removes the previous form of immunity.
    - Zadacrel can cast any 9th level spell or below without any material components. 
    - Zadacrel might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples.

## Magnus "The First Scholar" 
##### "I am still learning. - Magnus" 
When the solars were born, the multiverse was young and the term scholar was yet to be coined. While all of the solars were inquisitive and curious, none of them were on the same level as Magnus. 

Xephalam was slightly worried, that his younger brother would do something stupid or endanger himself due to his curiousness, so Xephalam gave him a little more attention. Xephalam decided to be a teacher towards Magnus, but also teach the other young solars when they were lost or needed guidance.  

Magnus appreciated and took to heart the teachings of Xephalam. While the other solars immediately sought for adventure and evil, so they can destroy them, Magnus stayed with his brother and only went out to catalogue and learn new knowledge. He would then return to learn more from his eldest brother.

As the multiverse grew and the primordials came along with the gods, the solars became even more busy, but Magnus decided to simply study more. He started to learn magic and even developed new spells. 

There came a time when Magnus returned the last book, Xephalam had, to Xephalam's library. When there was nothing else to learn, Magnus was almost too distraught, as if his path was suddenly cut off. 

Xephalam was aware of his brother's plight, so he brought him to his mythical garden. Magnus was scared and amazed as his eldest brother's garden was said to be the representation of true magic, an ability that only those he brings there could inherit.

Thirsty for more knowledge, Magnus asked for this ability but Xephalam said that one cannot truly know or understand something until they saw it for what it truly was. Confused and lost, Magnus asked what his brother meant. 

Xephalam simply told him one thing, go out and travel the multiverse. Surprised and slightly scared Magnus agreed. He knew one day he would need to got out and travel, it was both his duty and also a new form of learning. 

During Magnus' time of studying and learning he mastered magic, not only one kind but all of them. His mastery of spells was so perfect that there is a rumor that the most legendary mages and sorcerers were all taught or had some form of guidance from Magnus, which some of them did. 

At first, Magnus carefully travelled the multiverse but then he noticed that despite his time being cooped up in his brother's study, he still had the inherent burning desire to help and save everyone. Something that all solars feel when they are in the presence of evil or if someone is in need of help. 

He tried to help everyone but like his siblings he was not omnipotent. Even with all of the magic Magnus can use, he realized that that despite how much he learned none of his siblings nor him are close to the insurmountable wall that they call their eldest.

Desperate for more power to protect those that need him, he met with a being of equal skill and control to magic, the goddess of all magic, Mystra. 

Mystra was thoroughly surprised that Magnus would ever visit her.

To a lot of gods, Magnus was new because he appeared late. But that did not lessen his reputation. Even the strongest gods were respectful of the legendary solar as he was the first being to master all the forms of magic and spells, something that not even Mystra could boast. 

To learn more and to be more, Magnus said the words that no other solar has said yet. He pledged himself to Mystra, making him the first mage and the first pledged solar. At first Mystra was baffled and asked if such a thing was possible. 

Magnus said it was possible. It would strengthen Magnus by a large margin if she accepted his pledge. He also mentioned that while they are equals now, he would surpass her the moment she accepts his pledge. She asks what she would get in return, Magnus told her that her power would not increase but he would be her strongest and most loyal servant.  

The other gods were almost baffled at this and a lot of them wanted to offer him their domain but he was adamant that if he were to offer his service he will only accept Mystra's hand. 

Debating the offer, eventually Mystra accepted and fused her domain with him.

Ironically, before the fusion of his divine power and her domain, they were equals but Magnus became noticeable stronger than her when she fused her domain with him.

At first this troubled Mystra, as she feared he would betray or not respect her at all. But to her surprise Magnus has been both loyal and helpful. While he pledged himself to her for power, he knew that keeping a respectful relationship with someone of equal power and stature was both a learning experience for the two of them. But it was mostly because his eldest brother told him that respecting deals and favors are the right thing to do.

Being the ultimate follower of his eldest brother, Magnus naturally followed and stayed loyal to Mystra. He advised and helped her on subjects she would have a hard time doing and she appreciated his talented point of view.

When it came to combat, most powerful beings would not dare to fight Mystra, not because she was a greater god but because she had a powerful ally that would protect her no matter what. 

Magnus is quite famous, especially to mages, due to his great works in magic, with the amount of spells, rituals and magical techniques he has passed down to mortalkind. 

While staying with Mystra has helped Magnus immensely, he loves to travel and constantly visits different planes and other universes, in search for more magic and knowledge. But the place Magnus most visited was his eldest brother's library. While Xephalam keeps a very huge library, it is unique in the fact that everyday it grows larger. It is filled with a powerful enchantment so that it renews itself daily, adding all of the new knowledge, in all of the multiverse, no exceptions. But despite that Magnus always comes back to spend time with Mystra.  

Until now, the two users of magic became close friends, some would even say more than friends but it would be blasphemy. 

When Magnus fights, his methodical and near perfect usage of magic allows him to fight almost everyone, except his eldest brother, as he admits even with all of the solars combined they would not be able to defeat him. 

Despite being titled as the fourth strongest, Magnus can handily defeat both Adithar and Taciax and
the only reason he is not ranked above them is because his legends and feats have not caught up to theirs. But no matter what Magnus fights to turn the multiverse into a better place. 

### Magnus' Field of Judgement
When Magnus creates his field, it manifests as a peaceful 1000-mile field with an unbreakable 1-mile radius sized library in its center. It is said that due to Magnus' pledge to Mystra his control and usage of magic has become so powerful, he surpasses her. While Magnus affects the whole field, his combat capabilities are fully realized when inside his massive library in the center of his field. This massive library is the full collection of Magnus' knowledge, ranging from basic alchemy to world ending spells. And unlike his siblings Magnus has perfect control over his field and can use it anytime. Once Magnus activates his field, a 1000-mile radius would be filled with his perfectly controlled, domain-fused, divine energy for 100 years. Unlike other solars that gain powerful boosts when in their field, Magnus is one of the fabled super solars, immensely powerful and nigh unstoppable beings, and thus when he activates his domain, he enters a new state or form that is massively more powerful than the other. Once transformed, his ability to cast spells and manipulate magic almost transcends common sense.

Due to the extremely powerful nature of Magnus' powers instead of gaining bonuses when he is in his field, Magnus instead gets a different statblock. 

> ##### Magnus "The Curator of Infinity" 
> If Magnus uses his field and transforms, his health is refilled to max and every spell slot used up is also refreshed. Use his second stat block. Once Magnus uses his field form his CR increases to 41 (435,000 XP).

### Library of Magnus
While less impressive than Xephalam's personal library, the library of Magnus has allowed mortal eyes to peruse its colossal collection of otherworldly knowledge, albeit a mortal needed Magnus' agreement for them to go in. It contains knowledge from all parts of the multiverse, even from places such as the far realm, which he gathered with the help of his other brother, Clarion. 

Legendary sages, immortal kings, powerful adventurers, fading liches and dying gods have all visited Magnus for knowledge and with hope that he would have what is needed to save them. A large majority of them were disappointed, not because Magnus did not have the knowledge but simply because they were denied of entrance.

But despite his massive collection, Magnus has one thing he can never find proper information about. It is knowledge about his eldest brother. Multiple times he has asked his brother where he came from and what he is. This is due to the fact that Magnus believes that Xephalam is not a solar, and he is something more but no evidence have come to light and every creature that is old enough to know hides and those that do not hide refuse to answer. This has been the greatest mystery Magnus has yet to solve and he swears he will find out, because maybe his brother is the key beyond all of creation.

When visiting his library looking for knowledge or help, they must at least be sufficiently experienced and have a good alignment but sometimes Magnus makes exceptions as he knows that there is such a thing as necessary evil.

When powerful beings visit his massive library, ranging from gods to demons, Magnus all assesses them. The most basic requirements are simple: 
- A player character must at least be level 10 but Magnus can give them an exemption.
- A creature must have a good alignment but Magnus can give them an exemption. 
- A creature must be willing to be subjected to a powerful *geas* spell as to prevent battles in the library.
- A creature must also not have any history of thievery or else the library immediately expels them, even if Magnus allows their presence. 

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Magnus can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Magnus takes a book from one of the unbreakable library shelves and recites its mystifying words. Each creature that has at least 5 Intelligence within 100 feet of him must make a DC 28 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is charmed by Magnus' infinite and tempting knowledge and obeys every command Magnus tell him to. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature is not charmed but their speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.

- Magnus takes a book from one of the unbreakable library shelves and recites its destructive words. Each creature that has at least 5 Intelligence within 100 feet of him must succeed on a DC 28 Intelligence saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute on a failed save, or half as much damage and not be stunned on a successful one. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of their turn to remove the stunned effect.

- Magnus takes a book from one the unbreakable library shelves and recites its debilitating words. Each creature that has at least 5 Intelligence within 100 feet of him must make a DC 28 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature gain two levels of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes one level of exhaustion. Creatures can fall unconscious from the levels of exhaustion instead of dying if Magnus wishes. 

\columnbreak

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Magnus is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- The mythical library of Magnus is spotted at the center of the field.
- A powerful sense of advancement and progress fills the air. Creatures, especially intelligent ones gain once every millenium inspirations to progress and advance their technological state. It is not unheard of for kingdoms to settle near Magnus' library, with his permission of course.
- All animals, undead, and even monsters such as the tarrasque gain the effects of the spell *awaken*. They enjoy a small form of sentience that lasts as long as Magnus' field stays. Once Magnus' field fades, so will this effect.

### Infinity Magic: Knowledge
When Magnus mastered the usage of magic, he started to review his eldest brother's strongest power, the Infinity Magic. When he learned of its existence, he immediately strived to learn more and in the process, he eventually developed his own form of Infinity Magic, which is based on the concept of knowledge.

## Remphar "The Astral Time-Spacekeeper" 
##### "We are a manifestation that we perpetuate through space-time. Death is the ceasing of the observation of it whether by direct or indirect influence.. - Remphar" 

Time is a rigid power that will never go backward, or stop, it only goes forward, but for the extremely powerful and mighty, time becomes a malleable power that is often used to devastating effects. Remphar, a famous solar, learned how to manipulate this dangerous yet mighty power. 

Remphar perfected time manipulation, to the point where he can stop time and prepare for the long run instead of it just being a breather. But due to the amount of time he spent on perfecting time control, he was slightly weaker on his other abilities. While his utility in the battlefield was near unbeatable, his ability to deal damage was quite pitiful, considering he was a solar. 

Despite this, Remphar is still extremely powerful and while his destructive power is relatively low compared to other solars, for most beings below the standards of a solar it is more than enough.

Due to time being technically infinite, Remphar, arguably  has the biggest responsibility out of all the solars, if not considering the eldest.

But fortunately, Remphar asked for help from his eldest brother. While solars prefer fighting alone, it is a common fact for all of them, that asking for help from their eldest brother is nothing shameful, and sometimes even encouraged by other siblings. When Remphar asked for help from his eldest brother, he created powerful constructs that had a small percentage of his essence, allowing them to travel through time and protect it by destroying those beings that wanted to affect the timeline. 

During his time of strengthening himself and protecting the safety of the space-time continuum, Remphar noticed something. He noticed powerful creatures that were literally eating timelines, something that scared even him. Dubbing them as time-eaters, Remphar immediately set out to destroy them.

At first he sent his constructs to destroy these beings, it worked at first, but the stronger creatures destroyed his constructs. When his constructs were wiped out and the creatures were still many, he started to take matters in his own hands, only to be defeated as these creatures were immune to his time based abilities, and his space based abilities were inferior at the time. 

In fear of their possible rampage, Remphar asked for help one more time, but this time his eldest sibling denied him and told him this was his responsibility. 

Instead of mulling around, Remphar started to train his power as quickly as he could without endangering himself. As more timelines were getting destroyed, Remphar became stronger and stronger but not strong enough to defeat those beings. 

When the time-eaters reached his brother's realm, he immediately went to defend him. Xephalam was in the midst of drinking tea, when the time-eaters went into his realm. As he reached his brothers realm, he saw him drinking tea and noticed that no more time-eaters were there or anywhere at all. 

Xephalam cleared his confusion and congratulated him for finishing his training. Xephalam Xephalam reminded him that despite his work, he should never let himself weaken or else his responsibility will be in danger. 
Remphar nodded respectfully and left his brother to enjoy his tea.

### Remphar's Field of Judgement
When the solars learned of the concept of time, they all learned a few tricks and a few abilities, 
but none of them is as skilled and as devoted to time control as Remphar. His field is said to be something akin to a starry void, that has small floating rocky islands as platforms. As long as his enemies are users of time powers or wish to tamper with time itself, Remphar can activate his powerful field. Once he uses his field, a 1000 mile radius would be filled with his divine energy transformed into an infinite void-like area for 100 years. Remphar's CR increases to 30 (155,000 XP) inside his field.

Once in his field Remphar gains the following bonuses:
- Remphar constantly emits an aura that is similar to the *slow* spell, within 10 feet of him. Creatures that start their turn in a 10-foot radius around Remphar must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw at the start of their turns or be affected by it. 
- Remphar's Warped Space trait's range is reduced to 20 feet. 
- Remphar's time is different to other creatures and he is always under the effect of the *haste* spell. Any spell or effect that can restrain him, temporarily disables this effect. An 8th level dispel magic stops his *haste* effect for 1 minute.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Remphar can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Remphar casts the spell *time stop* and he can take 5 turns immediately, before the normal turn sequence resumes. This lair action cannot be used again for the next 5 rounds.
- Remphar focuses his powers on one creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or enter stasis. A creature in stasis is incapacitated, cannot be moved in any way unless stated otherwise, and is immune to all damage. This effect lasts for 3 turns, before the effect ends. Once used on a creature, whether they succeeded or not, they become immune to it for 24 hours.
- Remphar rewinds his own time back to the previous round, healing all the damage dealt to him during that round, recharging used recharge based actions, refreshing his used spells & refreshing used traits. Remphar can only use this ability once. 

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Remphar is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Every once in a while, portals that show the future appear.
- Large and powerful constructs (Iron Golems) travel the land in a 1000 mile radius around Remphar. 
- Biological needs of creatures in his area stop needing to be fulfilled. Creatures do not need to eat, breathe or sleep.

> ### Actions
> ***Reality Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +18 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 87 (14d10 + 10) force damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become 1d20 years older or younger (Remphar's choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A greater restoration spell can restore a creature's age to normal. 
>
>***Space Break (Recharge 6).*** Remphar destroys a 5-foot radius area centered on a point he can see within 60 feet of him by expanding the space in that area. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature and everything it carries is erased from existence. On a successful save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) force damage. If a creature is erased, only a wish spell or similarly powerful magic can bring back the erased creature.
>
>***Time Stop (Recharge 6).*** Remphar stops time, similar to the spell *time stop*, but he does not need to maintain concentration on it. Remphar can use this action to extend his lair action's time stop ability by 5 more turns, totaling 10 turns. This ability does not recharge during its duration or during the spell *time stop*.  
>
>***Force Mine.*** Remphar creates a small, undetectable, immoveable, indestructible bomb of space ripping energy in a 5-foot cube on a point he can see within 200 feet of him. A creature can use its action to make a DC 26 Intelligence (Investigation) check to attempt to find the location of the closest bomb to it. 
If two bombs have the same proximity, a random one is chosen. Once a creature ends their turn in a 15-foot radius around the mine, Remphar can choose to let it explode with magical force in a 30-foot radius around it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (6d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Remphar is unaffected by this damage.
Remphar can set his mines while time is stopped, without time resuming. Remphar can only have 10 mines active at the same time. If he wants to place a new one, one of his of his active mines is removed.
>
>***Stasis (Recharge 4-6).*** Remphar makes a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of him and freezes their time, putting them in stasis. A targeted creature must succeed on a DC 26 Charisma saving throw or be put in stasis. A creature in stasis is incapacitated, cannot be moved, and is immune to all forms of damage. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ***Healing Touch (4/Day).*** Remphar touches another creature. The target magically regains 50 (10d8+5) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

This effect on him and the creature lasts until the end of the next round.

## Rundelia "The Undying Light" 
##### "Keep Going, your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going. Tough situations build strong people in the end. - Rundelia"

When your body is weak, what do you do? You push forward and struggle to victory. Rundelia is the 2nd youngest solar and possibly the one with the weakest body. For some unknown reason, when Rundelia was created, she had an extremely weak constitution. But what she lacked in physical power she made up with an individuality that can be said to be human.

While her other brothers and sisters were out destroying devils, thwarting apocalyptic plans, and learning more powers, Rundelia was exploring the multiverse with a few bodyguards, courtesy of her worried eldest brother. 

Although Rundelia's situation could have been fixed by Xephalam, she insisted that she stayed that way, believing that all the solars were created the way they were supposed to be. To her sibling's chagrin, Rundelia continued to explore the multiverse playing around and mostly being human-like.

Rundelia showed emotions so human that Arrid and Namar sometimes looked like robots compared to her, but this was what made her special. All of her siblings treated her like the young sister everyone protects, and no one has the bravery to try and attack this little ball of nigh-infinite divine energy. 

Despite her attitude and happy-go-lucky lifestyle, her siblings still had high expectations towards her, after all she was still a solar. She still had the heavy burden of being a celestial being, meant to do good. 

But unlike the other solars, Rundelia actually disliked her premade destiny, it ate her from the insides and she escaped. With her powerful potential and natural powers, she easily evaded her bodyguards and immediately went into hiding. 

Posing as a human, Rundelia hid in a young mortal world where her siblings have yet to go to. She was immediately caught by her eldest sibling but he allowed her to stay, surprising her. He explained that like all her other siblings, she will her find her own path, even if it meant that she had an unorthodox ways of doing it. 

Unfortunately, Rundelia found herself helping other people too often, to the point that the various churches were trying to claim her, as their messiah sent by their deities. Despite everything she did to try and not be a good solar, she failed. 

It was truly inside her to help others and eventually she just surrendered to her fate but did not immediately return. She decided to stay in the young budding world to help guide it in a way that was both moral and fulfilling. 

For a long while, she helped develop the young world, and eventually it was named Pardegan. Rundelia kept to the shadows until one day she met a young man by the name of Aeternum. To her surprise, she found herself enchanted, non-magically, by the young lad and she decided to take him in, when she found out he had no family.

She taught him usage of magic, although she wasn't very good at it. Aeternum learned well and was very grateful to her.

And just like what her human outlook suggested, she fell for him and he fell for her.

Embarrassed and ashamed of her humane predicament, Rundelia left Aeternum and decided to return to her world to join her siblings. What Rundelia did not take into account for, was the fact that Aeternum did everything to follow her after a few centuries of amassing power.

###  Aeternum "The Patient Immortal"
##### "If you want a rose, don't hide from the thorns. Just as if you want love, don't hide from yourself. - Aeternum"

If average was the game, Aeternum won it. Other than his grand name, Aeternum was as average as one could possibly get. His mediocre talent, average looks and just barely passing physical strength showed how 100% average he was. 

But despite his mediocre stats and average talent, Aeternum was very stubborn. He was so stubborn he managed to sway the heart of the only human solar in existence, albeit he did not know. But his heart was swayed the moment he met Rundelia, it was practically love at first sight.

He always told himself that she was a miracle, and he decided that one day he will become high and mighty and take her as his wife, so he decided to improve and grow as a person. To his complete surprise Rundelia was an accomplished magic caster, although she claims her siblings are far stronger than her. 

She was kind enough to teach him how to cast magic and he listened to her every word, so that one day his dream will be accomplished. If anything, Aeternum was a simple man with a very simple dream, he wanted to find someone to spend the rest of his life with. 

When he finally had a good grasp of his magical skills and learned how to use weapons, she suddenly disappeared. He felt utterly heartbroken and he was for the first time in his life, lost. He was drowning in grief and almost ended his pitiful life when he heard of a magic that allowed him to go anywhere as long as he knows where he needed to go, even if it is just the person's name.

With his inner fire reignited once more, Aeternum packed up and started travelling his world, making legends, helping others and slaying demons until eventually he gained the power to rip a portal through reality to find Rundelia.

As he amassed so much power, Aeternum already found the secret to immortality and did not care if Rundelia was already old by the time he found her, he still planned to marry her.

When he ripped a gate into the world to find her, he found her already at the brink of death fighting a powerful demon lord who she could not defeat due to her weak body. Without hesitating, Aeternum immediately joined the fight just to save her, even if it meant death.

When the battle was over and he prevailed, he went to the dying Rundelia and immediately started to try and save her. Without her permission, he immediately bonded his soul with hers. To his surprise, Rundelia's soul was godlike in terms of power but but he did not care, he did not want her to die.

When Rundelia woke up and found out about what happened, she became angry but immediately was happy, because she finally saw the man she fell for again. Whatever happened to them afterwards remains a mystery, but there is a famous rumor of a couple traversing the multiverse protecting it from danger. The couple was said to be inseparable.

### Rundelia's Field of Judgement
Born from the humane nature of Rundelia, her field is extremely safe. Unlike the field of her siblings, Rundelia's field does not cause worldly damage or any form of destruction, except through the powerful abilities she receives.

When Rundelia was still travelling the young world she did not have her field yet, but when she met Aeternum and fell for him, her field was created. 

Unknown to everyone besides her deceased enemies and eldest brother, Rundelia's field is a representation of her wish to have a simple and peaceful life with Aeternum. It represents her desire to simply stop and drop all her responsibilities to run away with Aeternum.

The skies heal, the lakes flourish and the forests thrive, these are some of the few healthy effects of her very friendly field. But despite the safeness of her field, Rundelia is still a solar and she gains a repetoire of powerful abilities. Once she uses her field, a 1000 mile radius would be filled with her divine energy transforming it into a homely paradise for 100 years. Rundelia's CR increases to 26 (90,000 XP) inside her field.

Once in her field Rundelia gains the following bonuses:
- Rundelia's Healing Touch can heal Aeternum even if she no longer has any charges.
- If Rundelia uses her Immortal Love ability, her hit points do not go down to 1.
- Rundelia's radiant damage resistance becomes immunity. 
- The AC bonus from Lover's protection becomes +4 instead of +2.

Due to Aeternum's powerful connection with Rundelia, he also gains the following bonuses while in her field:
- Aeternum's Undying Devotion's DC still starts at 5 but it increases per successful save by 4 now, but if Rundelia is dead or has 0 hit points it increases per successful save by 2.
- The first time during a turn when Rundelia is damaged, the damage is halved, and Aeternum adds +5 to the damage roll of his next attack.
- As long as Aeternum is conscious, creatures that attack Rundelia have disadvantage.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Rundelia can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Rundelia heals herself and Aeternum by 15 hit points.
- Rundelia splits the heavens apart revealing the heavenly realms. She then calls down powerful lances of divine energy on up to three creatures that she can see. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, takin 33 (6d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.
- Rundelia and Aeternum  magically teleport, along with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, up to 150 feet to an unoccupied space they can see.

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Rundelia is warped by her magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Women that are barren are magically healed and can give birth to children.
- The chances for conception between couples is extremely high.
- Creatures that are born in Rundelia's field is naturally stronger and long lived.

## Iurstina "The Advocate for the Voiceless"
##### "OBJECTION! - Iurstina"

A lawyer, a prankster, and a godlike illusionist, all these traits describe one of the more famous solars, Iurstina. When the solars started to walk the multiverse and learn new things, Iurstina joined Aziraphale in his journey to learn good by approaching it from a law-based perspective. 

After a few years of continuous study of the law, the first thing that came to Iurstina's mind was that the law was flawed and could be exploited by loopholes. Unlike Aziraphale who did not wish to deviate from the knowledge presented in the books, Iurstina started to create her own system. 

She left her brother to his books and she started to explore the world, applying the knowledge she learned to every situation with a little bit of improvising. Iurstina wished to create a flawless law system that would be the official law system of the heavenly realms.

Unfortunately not all parts of the law happened frequently and this really put a stop to Iurstina's plan of perfecting her law system until she met one of her sisters during her travels. She met her extremely happy go lucky sister, Rundelia and she found her bubbliness to be extremely different compared to Aziraphale. Then it hit her, she did not need to wait for the crime to happen, she could orchestrate it herself without hurting anyone. 

After spending some time with Rundelia, her mind was filled with ideas and mischievious plans. This is where her title as the Celestial Joker came to life. Iurstina started to create harmless but extremely annoying pranks that affected mortals. And when they came to complain about it to the governing body, she started to fix the loopholes used against the unfortunate mortal. Once done with a specific mortal, she would help them fix their lives through the usage of her knowledge. Unfortunately for her siblings, Iurstina seemed to have made this playful attitude a part of her.

Some of her victims included but were not limited to Aziraphale, Velik, Tystra and rarely Rundelia. She loves pranking her stoic and sometimes too serious brother Velik. She also was keenly aware of what happened to Aziraphale and was trying to shock him out of his current state through her playful attitude. Sometimes she pranks the melancholic Tystra just to get her to smile or at least laugh. Despite her mischief ridden attitude, Iurstina cares deeply for her family.   

It is due to this that Iurstina developed her own form of abilities and powers. In addition, Iurstina learned soul magic from Adithar because once she realized that the beings that abuse the law system the most are devils, she knew that she would need to learn how to fight them when it comes to souls. Iurstina developed a powerful mastery of illusion based magic and soul magic, which she learned from Adithar. 

Slowly but surely, Iurstina was filling the nigh infinite amount of loopholes inside the law system. After thousands of lighthearted pranks and fixed loopholes, Iurstina had another problem. She could use mortals as a way to fix the loopholes of the easier and lighter crimes in the law system but what about the more dangerous crimes such as murder or even genocide. 

Out of all the evil beings that Iurstina abhors, devils are the ones she hates the most.

She knew that if she were to continue her path of perfecting the law, she would be facing the most cunning creatures in the multiverse, the devils. With her mastery of soul magic and perfect control of illusion magic, Iurstina travelled to the depths of the 4th layer of Phlegethos to bargain for the souls that were unjustly taken by the loophole exploiting devils. Iurstina knew that no matter what she did the devils would never surrender the souls unless she gave them something they want. Iurstina also knew that the devils would not start opening up trials unless she started to show her bargaining chips.

As revenge and a solution to her problems, Iurstina started to hunt large devil cults and capture evil souls. She captured a multitude of evil mortals, lesser devils, and even greater devil. Iurstina went back to hell with a proper barganing chip and started to make deals with the devils. In exchange for the evil souls, she would recieve the innocent and unfairly treated souls. The devils believed they would easily trick the solar but to their shock, Iurstina was absolutely perfect in her handling and she easily released the good and innocent souls back to the stream of reincarnation. 

As the millenniums passed, Iurstina has saved millions of innocent souls and her understanding of law became better and better until one day she felt a door inside her soul. Once she opened it she felt a new understanding of law and she gained a form of True Magic, which is Law

Most beings would think that Iurstina is a stoic judge due to her close relationship with Aziraphale and some would think that she is a playful celestial that takes pleasure in fooling and pranking others but this is not the entire truth. Iurstina can be as stoic as Aziraphale but when the time calls for it, she can be as kind and compassionate as Arrid as well or even as playful as Rundelia but Iurstina understands that the multiverse cannot be saved solely out of kindness from someone like Arrid or even the foresight of Aziraphale, something she learned from the eldest. She understands that sometimes if she wants to do good, she must be willing to dip into the darker side. Despite this, Iurstina keeps her guard up so that she never falls to the corruption every solar fears.

During her free time when she is not fixing the law system's loopholes or bargaining against devils, Iurstina would sometimes visit Aziraphale and Magnus for a refresher, play pranks on her stern siblings, or just rest in Xephalam's garden. 

Iurstina often says: "She who fights with monsters should look to it that she herself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."

### Iurstina's Field of Judgement
When order and chaos mix, the result is the manifestation of law. This singular chaos controlling and order moving word is what represents Iurstina's powerful field. During the creation of her field, Iurstina was already making deadly deals with the most cunning and evil devils so she was heavily familiar with the court of Phlegethos. 

When she created her field it was made with one purpose, to judge those that she deems evil and are worth using as a bargaining chip against the devils. Iurstina's field only has two requirements. The first is that whoever she deemed to be worthy using her field against is evil and the last requirement must be that their soul is worth using to save another innocent soul from the depths of hell. In her field Iurstina is almost borderline unfair and most enemies under trail would appeal for unfair and biased court ruling but Iurstina never picks a fair enemy, she only picks unfair ones. 

When her field is activated a colossal and unbreakable court appears in the center. In this court, Iurstina gets to decide her opponents fate, if they are evil then their soul will be used to save others, but if they are innocent then they will be set free. Once she uses her field, a 1000 mile radius would be filled with her divine energy transforming it into a orderly continent for 100 years. Iurstina's CR increases to 28 (105,000 XP) inside her field.

Once in her field Iurstina gains the following bonuses:

- Iurstina can imprison creatures with *Guilty as Charged* when she has 4 evidences against them instead of 5.
-  When Iurstina uses *Frameup* she can instead choose a creature other than herself. The creature must succeed on a DC 27 Charisma saving throw or switch positions with Iurstina's illusionary clone. 
- Iurstina's illusion shatter in  an 10-foot radius when they are destroyed. Every creature in the area must succeed on a DC 27 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of her next turn. 

\pagebreakNum

### Vehmgericht 
The ultimate manifestation of just and fair law, Vehmgericht or Court Vehm for short is the physical manifestation of Iurstina's desire to perfect the law system but also an outlet for her extreme mischievousness. In the middle of Iurstina's field is a massive, unbreakable building used for arrests. The huge building is Court Vehm and inside Court Vehm, thousands of evil beings have been charged guilty to be sentenced to soul bargaining.

While the court manifests Iurstina's powerful connection to the law, she also manifests her joker-like humor through the use of massive teleportation control and illusions. In Iurstina's field, literally thousands of illusionary copies of her appear. Each one of these illusionary copy is solid and can maintain their physical form and they also have a small form of sentience separating them from the original Iurstina. Despite their small form of sentience they are extremely loyal to Iurstina.

They also have the same form of humor as Iurstina and will go to any lengths to follow her witty, mischief-ridden ideas. These illusionary copies act as bodyguards, patrols, police and when they are located in the court, they act as the audience, prosecutors and jury.  

When beings visit Vehmgericht, they are immediately assessed by the illusionary copies that exist there. These are the requirements:

- A player character must at least be level 10 but Iurstina can give an exemption.
- A creature must have no intention to release or help a trapped creature escape. The court house and Iurstina are aware of this when they enter the field.
- A creature that has a soul worthy for devil bargaining is subject to a *hold person* spell that lasts for 24 hours with a Spell DC of 27. The creature can repeat the saving throw every 1 hour, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20(losing ties). Iurstina can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Iurstina creates 4 perfect illusionary copies that appear in an unoccupied space that Iurstina can see within 60 feet of her, she then unnoticeably switches her position with one of the illusionary clones. They last until she takes another lair action. Each illusion follows the rules of her *witness* trait, except that these illusions cannot be distinguished from the real Iurstina. In addition, truesight cannot determine which one is an illusion and which one is the real Iurstina. 
- Every creature of her choice in her field must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, then the next time within the next hour, when they fail a Charisma check or Charisma saving throw, they begin to turn to stone and are restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
- Iurstina casts one of her illusion-spells without expending a use of her innate spellcasting. She can choose to make that illusion real. The illusion remains real for 1 minute. The illusion cannot deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Iurstina is warped by her magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- In her field criminals unconsciously tend to leave a lot more evidence behind and law enforcement is wittier and luckier in finding criminals and bringing them to justice.
- Judges, lawyers and prosecutors gain more insight in their cases and are compelled to reach out to the truth in every single away and work towards a just and fair verdict.
- Iurstina's copies litter the field and each one of them have their own purpose. Most of them have law-based jobs such as police, guards, escorts, and jury but some of them are simply there to pull pranks on other beings.

### True Magic: Law
In the near future, Iurstina eventually perfected her law system and due to it she fully understood what law is allowing her to learn the concept of law. Eventually with enough time and practice, Iurstina learned the mastery of True Magic: Law. **This is a Variant of Iurstina.**

Her True Magic DC is **29**.
___
___
Due to her mastery of True Magic: Law, Iurstina gains the following bonuses:

##### Body Concept
- **Iuris.** Any creature that Iurstina does not acknowledge cannot look at, speak to, listen to, attack or casts a harmful spell to her in any way whatsoever.  Creatures that wish to interact with Iurstina without her acknowledgement must succeed on a DC 29 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature cannot interact with Iurstina. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the effect for 1 minute and can interact with Iurstina. If a creature wishes to harm Iurstina, it must succeed on a DC 29 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. Any area of effects that can damage or affect her such as a fireball or slow, dissipate into nothingness if the source of the effect does not succeed on its saving throw. Each time Iurstina's companions do anything harmful to an unacknowledged target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself for 1 minute on a success.

##### Reality Concept
- **Res Judicata.** Once Iurstina acknowledges a creature she can speak any word towards that creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 29 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature must obey no matter what type of command is given. On a successful save, nothing happens and the creature is immune to this effect for 1 minute. Iurstina can also give her words power by writing them down. She can write down a law or declare a written text as law. Everyone who sees it must succeed on a DC 29 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature understands the law immediately and  must obey it no matter what is written in it. On a successful save, nothing happens and the creature is immune to this effect for 1 minute. Creatures that fail their saving throw against these effects are permanently affected by her command. These effects can only be removed by a 10th level *wish* spell. Additionally a creature can repeat the saving throws once per year, ending the effects on a success.

##### Will Concept
- **Peerage.** Iurstina can bestow on or take away titles and names from people she acknowledges. If it is a positive title or name then the creature gets a permanent +4 bonus to all of its saving throws, ability checks and Attack rolls. If she takes someone's title or name or gives them a negative one then they must succeed on a DC 29 Charisma saving throw or get a permanent -4  on all of their saving throws, ability checks and Attack rolls. Iurstina can revoke names and titles anytime she wishes, removing the effects. These effects can only be removed by a 10th level *wish* spell. Additionally a creature can repeat the saving throws once per year, ending the effects on a success.

## Eridion "The Saint of Progress"
##### "Work with others to achieve your goals. Community and order are always stronger than the disjointed efforts of lone individuals. Tame the wilderness to make it fit for habitation, and defend the light of civilization against the encroaching darkness. Seek out new ideas, new inventions, new lands to inhabit, new wilderness to conquer. Build machines, build cities, build empires. - Eridion" 

When solars die, they resurrect after 24 months and resume their duties but when a solar becomes corrupted, then it becomes a matter of how long can the corrupted solar last before its powerful siblings hunt it down. When the corrupted solar is finally slain and its essence renewed and reincarnated, a brand new solar is born.

This was the birth of Eridion. He was officially the 25th solar. Even though he is newly reincarnated, Eridion retains multiple glimpses of his past life, remembering the times where he slayed powerful fiends and also the time when he was slain by his siblings. While Eridion appears unfazed and unaffected by his old past, he secretly fears death, not just death but the way his predecessor died, being slain by family. 

Eridion understands that every solar is powerful, even Rundelia who has not developed her power is still a formidable being, but he knows that even with all their power they are but a drop in the wide cosmos of power. He knows that unless Xephalam or Magnus decides to become extremely active, the solars need to work together to actually affect the multiverse in a big way.

A single solar invading an abyssal layer or a circle of hell will have a hard time reaching their lords but if it was two or even three solars, they could easily destroy the enemies' base by working together. Eridion has tried many times to explain this idea to his siblings but somehow they are not listening. Bitter and self-loathing, Eridion drowned himself in both work and alcohol, despite being completely immune to any form of inebriation.

Eridion has a very bright mind, not saying that the other solars are weak-minded but Eridion is considerably bright compared to most of his siblings. His ability to comprehend magic and extremely advanced technology was phenomenal, so when he finally decided on his path, he became an artificer, so he could create soldiers that would protect him from death. 

Eridion did not stop at just creating soldiers, with the knowledge Magnus had at his library, Eridion had access to all the most ancient and recent books concerning artificers and he created a powerful suit of armor that acted as a substitude for his relatively weaker power. Due to Eridion's recent reincarnation, he knew that it would take him millennia to regain his strength, so instead he wanted to find other ways to increase his power. 

Eridion took his time to look for answers and found the solution to his problems in a place that beings like him usually ignore, the ingenuity of mortals. Mortals are weak, with non-magical bodies and non-magical weapons, but they somehow persisted and rule the material plane despite the stronger beings living besides them. Eridion travelled in the mortal planes wearing his mortal guise and started to interact with other mortals. 

The first thing he realized is that when drinking alcoholic substances he should first polymorph to a form that can get inebriated to get as drunk as possible. The second thing is that mortals managed to survive by learning to arm themselves with powerful armaments created from their ever advancing technology. 

With all the time and resources he had on his hands, Eridion started replicating the mortals and started to study the art of inventing and creating technological marvels. At first he made simple objects such as small stopwatches but with the help of his siblings, he has created dozens of powerful magical items he employs in battle along with his powerful repertoire of technological soldiers. 

Eridion's new reincarnation garnered the close attention of all his siblings, especially Magnus who was happy to have a sibling studying with him. Magnus noticed that despite the best efforts of his siblings Eridion became a little bit pessimistic after his reincarnation. He tries to act in a tough, rude manner and sometimes overly egoistical, which his siblings point out. 

Eridion has created many magical items and trinkets, so many even that he started selling them by bulk. Unbeknownst to most of his siblings, Eridions created a powerful, large and multiplanar organization that manufactures and handles the distribution of magical items all over the multiverse.

Eridion knows that he is not invincible and unlike his eldest sibling he can die, he already died once. While Eridion might be the only solar to have truly died, he is also the only solar who is supported trough the interworking of many beings, weak and strong, that expands all throughout the multiverse. 

Ironically, while Eridion has the largest mortal following all over the multiverse, other than Zadacrel, he also has the worst attitude out of all the solars. Velik can be a prick, Aziraphale can be the strictest celestial, and Magnus has once become so menacing and furious that the world where his library was located trembled, but Eridion is a full-blown narcissist and he acts more mortal than any of his siblings, except Rundelia, by showing off his vices. Despite this, Eridion is not evil, just like his siblings he is inherently kind and good and will do everything to protect others but unlike his siblings, he fears the dark shadow of death. 

There was once a story where Eridion destroyed a rampaging demon lord in the material plane and the first thing people saw after the demon's destruction was Eridion comforting a crying child. 

Eridion's youth and inexperience is what makes him so different compared to that other solars, while the original 24 solars have had eons of wisdom, Eridon had to start from scratch. His innate intelligence and power is what fuels his arrogance, hubris and sometimes clouds his judgement. 

During his exploration of the material plane, Eridion discovered a very advanced civilization relative to everything else near it. The city was named Zion, a beautiful young city that was both prosperous and extremely advanced for its time. Eridion noticed that the city has gotten the attention of dozens of powerful creatures and was utterly surprised by how it was still surviving without being manipulated by some powerful deity or something similar. Eridion concluded that Zion was already under the rule of a deity and decided it would be a waste of his time if he did not at least try this advanced civilization's alcohol.

Eridion noticed that when he entered Zion that it was extremely beautiful and it was more orderly than any civilization he had ever seen before. Eridion noticed that there were patrolling guards, educated children, and thriving businesses everywhere. While Eridion mostly spent his time enjoying the pleasures of the city and rooting out evil organizations such as devil cults and elemental prince cults, he found the leader of the city, a beautiful female mortal that appeared to be extremely wise for her age.

Despite her powerful magic, Eridion could easily see through the woman and he immediately saw a powerful goddess, one that he was not familiar with. At first Eridion did not want anything to do with her but his curiosity overcame him, as this was the first time he saw a deity in the material plane without her having any difficulties. The Solars, except Iurstina, despite all their great power and ability to use magic, are horrible at being stealthy. Their ability to crash a party is so unmatched, a paralyzed man could sneak better than them. This is because Solars shine like beacons in the dark, their divine energy unless tempered with extremely powerful illusion magic is blindingly bright. 

Eventually the goddess and Eridion met and his suspicions were confirmed. The goddess in mortal form was named Erathis, the Goddess of Civilization, The Uncaring, Keeper of Laws, the Silent Watcher, and the Hand of Judgment. Each title rung throughout her lifetime as a deity. She was the most influential representative of mortal kind and her appearance in the mortal world meant she was ready to guide the mortals again. 

Eridion, with all of his genius and arrogance, immediately started taunting the goddess. Erathis with all her experience and wise insight was uncaring of his attitude but instead asked him if he wanted to work for her. Eridion at first was surprised but asked why. Erathis told him that his technological skills are more or less equal to hers and she wanted a new perspective so she could improve. 

Eridion was at first hesitant but he has never been more impressed by any being he has met. Xephalam is too enigmatic for him to comfortably approach and Magnus' mindscape was too wide to be understood by beings like Eridion unless they have been living like him but Erathis was different, she had a mind that did not mince words, did not hold back on opinions and valued efficiency more than anything else, something he has been looking for a very long while.  

\pagebreakNum

Eridion asked what the future of Zion was and Erathis answered, 'It is to be the technological model that every mortal kingdom will be following in the future'. Impressed and satisfied, Eridion agreed to her suggestion and decided to pledge his power to her.

While the other solars will gladly serve their masters loyally, Eridion and Erathis' relationship has been nothing but a long term argument. Ever since his pledging, Eridion and Erathis has been taking the multiverse by storm, their unparalleled genius and compatible style has been improving their skills by leaps and bounds. While they constantly debate over the technicalities of the technology they constantly innovate, they always manage to improve past what they create.

Ever since Eridion's pledge to Erathis, the two have seemed to appear like a family, a very dysfunctional one. While Eridion's attitude has become better over the decades and Erathis developed some form of emotions, mostly anger and frustration towards Eridion, they have both grown both in skill and personality.

Eridion and Erathis' powerful combination of knowledge and skill gave birth to many technological marvels that even the smartest of gods could only hope to imitate. In addition, due to Erathis connection with the mortals, Eridion also learned some measure of law and became a little bit closer with some of his siblings. And ever since Erathis showed Eridion the vastness of knowledge, he gained a new appreciation for it and started to spend more time in Magnus' library. Unfortunately due to Erathis' reputation of helping the mortals with her knowledge fully, Magnus has forbidden her from entering his library even with Eridion's permission. 

### Eridion's Field of Judgement
Due to Eridion's lack of experience, his field control is very lacking and because of this his field tends not to fully manifest his true will and due to this, he gains the uncanny ability to create temporary objects or items with the weak reality present in his field. His field's space is also naturally warped and serves as Eridion's vault of magical items, and only he can take those items. While this maybe intentional or accidental, Eridion fully utilizes his field's abilities to complement himself and his powerful constructs. When in his field Eridion's drones become a powerful force of nature capable of devastating their enemies, especially when Eridion starts to go serious. 

When his field is set, a 1000 mile radius would be filled with his divine energy for 100 years and unlike some of his siblings, the field actively focuses on the mental capacity of creatures living in the field. Similar to Magnus' field, creatures that are born inside it have a higher chance of becoming geniuses and every once in a while a prodigy would appear.

Eridion's CR increases to 30 (155,000 XP) inside his field.

Once in his field Eridion gains the following bonuses:

- If Eridion uses his Limited Upgrade to upgrade his drones he can choose to upgrade them up to 4 times.
- Eridion's Seraphim Bastion shield increases to 12 hit points. In the case of Eridion's Seraphim Bastion shield already being damaged, it resets back to 12 hit points if he sets his field. 
- When Eridion repairs a Seraphiex Machina they regain half of their hit points back.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties). Eridion can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Eridion forces his drones to overload. For one round they have maximum upgrades, but after that they lose all upgrades and he has to start upgrading them again. Eridion cannot use this lair action again for 24 hours after it was used.

- Eridion can order a Seraphiex Machina to take one action.

- Eridion harnesses the content of his magic vault of items that he created. He is considered attuned to the item he chooses and is considered to fulfill all of its prerequisites. He summons a wondrous item of very rare or lower rarity, he then uses one of its effect once if it requires an action or bonus action. If it has a continuous effect it last until the the end of Eridion's next turn. After that the items return back to his vault.

\columnbreak

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Eridion is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Magical constructs gradually develop limited sentience. 
- Settlements grow faster. The time that is needed for a village to become a town, a town to become a city, a city to become a metropolis and so on is significantly reduced. 
- Invention and progress thrives and people are more productive and successful in their ventures.

### Seraphiex Machina
When Eridion and Erathis were both nose deep in inventing and creating more machines, Eridion remembered his sister, Rundelia. While Rundelia is undoubtedly the weakest of the solars, even weaker than him, she was never defeated in combat and this baffled Eridion. He only realized it when he actually studied her fighting style. Rundelia was definitely a powerful solar but her greatest strength was her ability to fight in tandem with the exceptional mortal she calls her lover. Their ability to fight together removes her weakness and instead strengthens her. Eridion was sure that he could not defeat Rundelia and Aeternum if he was alone and he was even more sure that some of the other solars would agree. 

When he finally realized this, a brand new idea entered his brilliant mind and he started creating powerful constructs that will help him with fighting. During his creation, a new idea entered his mind and he said 'I don't need to fight, I can just have my creations fight for me'. With slight madness in his eyes and righteous zeal, the Saint of Progress set on creating the Seraphiex Machina, a group of powerful constructs that would prove to be extremely effective when fighting together.   

**Prometheus.** A large golem-like construct literally built to take hits and absorb damage. All of the Seraphiex Machina have a small form of sentience. Ironic to his huge size, Prometheus is naturally gentle and has a very soft spot for children, something that developed over time. Despite its gentleness, Prometheus will use all its strength to destroy any intrinsic evil it encounters. 

**Nightingale.** Eridon knew that while powerful constructs are very useful, he would need another one that can fully support the other constructs and keep them able for continuous amounts of battle. Like the other Seraphiex Machina, Nightingale developed its own form of sentience. Nightingale is an extremely efficient healer, capable of healing all manners of creatures, even the undead. Nightingale developed a very maternal like attitude when it came to dealing with the creatures it was allowed to heal.

**Templar.** Prometheus would usually take the majority of the hits when it comes to battles and Nightingale would constantly heal it, while Eridion skillfully manipulates the field through his constructs but their damage potential would be very limited and because of this weakness, Eridion created Templar. Templar was a skirmisher meant to deal quick and heavy damage against Eridion's enemies while being supported by the other Seraphiex Machina. Templar maintained a stoic attitude but was still very much like his other fellow constructs.  

**Genesis.** During one of Eridion's fiend hunting missions, he coincidentally met Velik, the greatest archer to have ever existed. This was during the time Eridion was still in the process of collecting information for the Seraphiex Machina. Eridion was fascinated by Velik's skill in long-ranged combat and he decided to collect information on his fighting style and incorporate it into a suitable construct. In time, Eridion managed to create Genesis, a construct that excels in long ranged combat, unfortunately Eridion was not able to create a construct on par with Velik. Despite not being able to reach Velik's skill, Genesis somehow copied Velik's aloof attitude but it is still a lawfully good construct like the other constructs.

**Oracle.** Created to spite destiny and fate, Eridion despises the prospect of fate and destiny controlling his past, present and future. To make sure that fate will never be able to hold him down, Eridion created a supercomputer capable of calculating millions of possibilities every second ensuring that Eridion will not encounter troubles. Oracle is meant to be a powerful support and an intelligent A.I. able to help Eridion properly manage and support the other constructs. Unfortunately, due to Oracle's heavy responsibilities and genius supermind, it is lacking in social abilities that the other constructs have but just like every other construct, it is lawfully good and will uphold good even when Eridion is absent.

Additionally he can touch it to activate, open or disarm it or attempt to overwrite its commands with his own. Eridion must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against the spell save DC of the object’s creator. If the creature is a naturally occuring object or construct and has no creator, Eridion can instead make a Charisma saving throw against the construct's challenge rating. If successful he gains control over it. If the object is temporarily animated, Eridion's control ends when the original duration of the magic animating it would end. Eridion can also take an action to precisely control up to 5 mechanical or technological objects within 200 feet of him. This includes objects that do not have power and are only reasonably damaged. If an object is too damaged for use, Eridion cannot properly use it. The device will continue to follow the instructions given by Eridion for up to a minute after contact is broken.
> When using the mending spell Eridion can physically repair a magic item or construct. Eridion can restore a broken magical item, reinfusing its magical properties with his own magical divinity. Eridion cannot use the mending spell to restore spent charges of a magical item. 
>
> ***Seraphim Bastion.*** An invisible barrier protects Eridion's body that is powered by his drones as long as at least one is in a 500 feet radius around him. The barrier has a total of 10 hit points and can only be reduced by reducing any one of his drones to 0 hit points. Reducing a drone to 0 hit points reduces the barrier's hit points by 1. In addition, Eridion is immune to all forms of damage until the barrier is destroyed and excess damage does not carry over to Eridion's hit points. 
> Any damage dealt to the barrier cannot be healed by any form of magic or ability except for a long rest.
>
> ***Seraphiex Machina.*** Eridion has 5 minions that are considered his drones. Each drone acts after Eridion's initiative in the following order, Prometheus, Nightingale, Templar, Genesis, and Oracle. If a drone is reduced to 0 hit points or is destroyed, Eridion can take an action and recreate the drone with 50 hit points. 
>
> ***Solar Sight.*** Eridion gains a +5 bonus to his Perception skill.
>
> ***Unwavering Connection.*** Eridion can telepathically talk with his constructs at any range as long as they exist within the same plane.

> 4. Buff. Eridion buffs a drone giving them advantage on attack rolls that lasts until the end of their next turn. In addition, the buffed drone has a +4 to all their saving throws that last until they make a saving throw. 
>
> 5. Overcharge & Attack. Eridion overcharges a drone raising its critical range up to 15-20 and commands it to make a melee weapon attack or ranged weapon attack. 
>
> ***Limited Upgrade.*** Eridion can choose one drone and temporarily upgrade them with three upgrades or choose three drones and temporarily upgrade three of them once or mix and match, Eridion's choice. Any Upgrade Eridion gives to his drones last for only 1 hour. 
>
> ***Healing Touch (4/Day).*** Eridion touches another creature. The target magically regains 50 (10d8+5) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

> 
>### Reactions
>
>***Activate: Energy Field*** If a drone of Eridion is hit by an attack or is damaged by any spell or effect, he can use his reaction and generate a powerful forcefield that affects that drone and grants it 30 temporary hit points that lasts until Eridion uses this ability on another drone.

## Mentis "The Heart of the Hurricane"
##### "What is freedom? The power to live as one wishes. - Mentis" 

When the solars were created, they did not all come to life at the same time, they came one by one from a divine embryo and despite the miracles being worked during their birth, there were some complications that appeared, such as Rundelia's weakness. One of these complicated embryos was Mentis and Maia's divine embryo. The divine embryos that contained the other solars each gained a singular consciousness but in Mentis' and Maia's case their divine embryo gained two consciousnesses. These consciousnesses were none other than Mentis and Maia. This complication was not too much of a problem. They would have still transformed into a normal solar despite the complication but what made them separate from each other was the possible results of their consciousnesses mixing and with that forever erasing their individuality.

The erasure of individuality scared the two beings in the embryo but instead of surrendering to fate like Rundelia, they decide to separate with the cost of losing some of their potential power. At first, Maia was hesitant of the separation because of the consequences. There was the possibility that Mentis would die because of her and if that happened, she would never forgive herself but Mentis was already growing impatient from not doing anything. After all, if they stayed, both of them would disappear but if one of them separates at least one of them would survive. Despite his rough and passionate attitude, Mentis, with his inherent solar nature, forcefully separated himself from Maia to save her and possibly give him a chance. Fortunately, the separation was successful, albeit with a loss of power on both of them. This was long ago and no one remembers the original story except the oldest of beings, so most creatures consider them twins due to the extreme similarity of their divine spark. 

Free and unbridled, these two word describe Mentis perfectly. As the one who willingly ripped himself off the divine embryo, Mentis has been living his life on the edge similar to a pubescent teenager that is finally starting to achieve independence but with a large serving of innate power. During his time of growth, Mentis was an extremely experimental solar. He took the initiative to try and learn many ways of gaining power but his enthusiasm lead him nowhere. He tried to learn too much but instead he learned very little. This did not stop his boundless optimism but he was not making any progress and when he saw Maia starting to unlock her powers, he sought advice among the other solars. 

He did not want to receive advice from Magnus, Adithar or Taciax, as he considered them to be his rivals. Instead he went to Kaiyoqua, the solar who managed to tame the power of the seas and Ragani who controls the essence of fire. Seeing them control the elements Mentis decided to follow that path as well. Ragani's power is the hot searing heat of fire, Kaiyoqua forces the powerful waves to crush his enemies and Mentis has decided to follow that path as well. But instead of copying them, he went to the elemental plane of air to find his way. At first he was having a hard time but with the help of Maia's newly acquired powers, he managed to subdue one of the princes of air. In exchange for its life, the prince of air taught Mentis the secrets of lightning and thunder. With his divine essence and drive to surpass his siblings, he easily learned and mastered the power given to him.

Once he mastered this magic, he felt truly free. He was finally free of living under his sibling's shadows, finally free of the oppressive chains of weakness and most of all he could roam the multiverse without having to worry about evil beings chasing him because you cannot catch the Heart of the Hurricane.

\columnbreak

### Mentis' Field of Judgement
Mentis has always strived to be free of the chains that restricted him. These restrictions are not limited to Maia, his stronger siblings and the setback he experienced from his birth. He truly wishes to be free but knows that if he truly wants to be free, he needs to find a way to destroy evil permanently making him free of his largest responsibility. When Mentis activates his field, a 1000 mile radius would be enveloped with powerful wind that can even damage structures if not properly supported for 100 years. Mentis' CR increases to 28 (120,000 XP) inside his field.

Once in his field, Mentis gains the following bonuses:
- Mentis gains all the benefits of the *haste* spell.
- For every feet of movement he moves in a straight line he charges his next attack. His next attack will deal an additional 1 lightning damage for every 20 feet he moved before attacking the target.
- Mentis' attacks, abilities and spells that deal lightning and and thunder damage ignore resistances and treat immunity as resistance.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties). Mentis can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Mentis conjures a hurricane in a 500 feet radius around him. This hurricane can not be controlled or dispelled by anyone except Mentis. Every creature in the area must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (4d8+10) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 100 feet away from Mentis in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. Mentis can only use this lair action once per day.
- Mentis can use this lair action only after he summoned the hurricane. He summons a giant lightning bolt from the sky which flashes before his enemies. Each creature of his choice in a 30-foot radius within 200 feet of him must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27(6d8) lightning damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and not be blinded on a successful one.
- Mentis can use this lair action only after he summoned the hurricane. Mentis can choose up to 6 creatures. A lightning bolt strikes these creatures as if they were hit by a 5th level call lightning. (The lightning will deal 6d10 damage under the stormy conditions.)

## Regional effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Mentis is warped by his magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Good creatures can run and move faster and generally feel more free.
- Chains, cages, prison cells and locks which imprison good creatures and deprive them of their freedom against their will, break very easily. Slavers, evil rulers and other oppressors feel watched all the time. 
- Ideas of revolution against oppression, tyranny and injustice flow more freely. Thoughts about freedom can be exchanged telepathically among good creatures.

## Maia "The Soul of the Soil" 
##### "Power, that's one thing, but love of family and of siblings is more important, is more powerful than any other power. - Maia" 

When the solars were created, they did not all come to life at the same time, they came one by one from a divine embryo aand despite the miracles being worked during their birth, there were some complications that appeared, such as Rundelia's weakness. Another of these complications was the birth of Maia and Mentis from their divine embryo. The divine embryos that contained the other solars each gained a singular consciousness but in Mentis' and Maia's case their divine embryo gained two consciousnesses. Even though they could have still transformed into one whole solar this would had lead to their consciousnesses mixing and the loss of their individuality.

The erasure of individuality scared the two beings in the embryo but instead of surrendering to fate like Rundelia, they decide to separate with the cost of losing some of their potential power. At first, Maia was hesitant of the separation because of the consequences. There was the possibility that Mentis would die because of her and if that happened, she would never forgive herself but Mentis was already growing impatient from not doing anything. After all, if they stayed, both of them would disappear but if one of them separates at least one of them would survive. Just like her caring and motherly attitude, Maia, with her inherent solar nature, tried to reason with Mentis that maybe everything would fix itself after all, she did not want to have her sibling get hurt. Fortunately, the separation was successful, albeit with a loss of power on both of them. This was long ago and no one remembers the original story except the oldest of beings, so most creatures consider them twins due to the extreme similarity of their divine spark.   

Caring and gentle, Maia perfectly fits these two words. As the one who stayed, Maia has decided to be a caretaker of sorts and has taken the effort to look after Mentis and his very impulsive attitude. When Mentis started to dabble in trying to gain a lot of power without any focus, she constantly reminded him to focus first but he wouldn't listen. She knew that he wouldn't listen so easily so instead of trying to convince him, she wanted to show him. While Mentis was focusing on trying to gain a lot of powers, Maia travelled to the garden of Xephalam, thought to be the most divine realm in the multiverse, to look for an object that could help supplement her weakened divinity. It took some time but at the middle of the garden, hidden beneath the field of primordial flowers was a powerful substance that even predates most of the gods. Its power was too much for Maia so she could not take it but she knew that somehow, she could replicate a weaker version of it but even then it would still be extremely powerful.

During her travels, Maia finally found the materials needed to replicated the powerful substance she discovered. It took a long time in the elemental plane of earth, and a few round trips in the feywild but Maia managed to create a powerful substance she calls Eitr Poison, a deadly poison to her enemies but a powerful healing liquid for her allies. Once she perfected the Eitr Poison, she gained an extremely powerful connection to elemental plane of earth and it almost became impossible to move, or escape her. 

She roams the multiverse in search of more power so that she will be able to protect herself and her siblings but mostly Mentis. If paired together with the fastest solar, they are nigh unbeatable.

### Maia's Field of Judgement
Maia has deemed that sometimes restrictions are important to an individual. While others sought to be free from these, Maia decided to use them to restrict others from doing more evil. One day if she manages to succeed, she will help her siblings permanently seal off the evil. When Maia's activates her field, a 1000 mile radius would have a powerful change.The earth is tougher making agriculture problematic but the soils are so fertile it's still worth it to till the ground for 100 years. Maia's CR increases to 28 (120,000 XP) inside her field. 

Once in her field, Maia gains the following bonuses:
- Maia's AC increases to 22.
- Maia's burrow speed is increased by 100 feet.
- Maia's poison now deals damage over time. As long as an enemy is poisoned they take their highest hit dice in poison damage at the start of their turn. 
- The poison damage of her Venomous Angelic Weapons increases to 27 (6d8) poison damage.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties). Maia can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Maia awakens a slab of earth to an earth elemental or a tree to a treant. She can only have one of each summoned at the same time, except when she uses Wrath of Nature, which increases the maximum to 4 of each.
- Maia snaps her whip and multiple poisonous vines shoot out from the earth. Every creature in a 60-foot radius around her must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failure they are restrained (escape DC 20) and take 13 (3d8) bludgeoning and 13 (3d8) poison damage at the start of their turn. While they are restrained in this way they also cannot attack. Dealing 30 slashing or fire damage to the vines (AC 15) destroys them and frees the creature.
- Maia controls the earth itself in a 1000 feet radius around her, shaping and moving it around to suit her needs. By shifting the earth she can freely change the landscape and shift the position of herself and every creature on the battlefield. This does not remove her ingrain bonus.

## Regional Effects
The region containing the field of judgement by Maia is warped by her magic, which creates all of the following effects:
- Non-poisonous food and water is poisonous for evil creatures, meanwhile poisonous food and water is non -poisonous for good creatures.
- Flora and Fauna prosper. The soil is more fertile and crops from the harvest are bigger and better in quality and quantity.
- When people till the farmland they can hear melodies coming from the earth. The songs are nursery rhymes sung in a soothing, beautiful voice. Children and farmer joining the song will feel more energetic for the day.

## Xephalam "King of the Heavens"
##### "To err is mortal; to forgive, divine. - Xephalam" 

Powerful, infinite and ancient, these three words have been used by many old beings to describe Xephalam, the purported first solar. Within a seemingly endless chain of hellish mountain ranges, there were two gargantuan mountain peaks well over a hundred thousand meters tall and a hundred feet apart from each other as it towered under the vast ocean of clouds. In the center of the two mountains, a being of heavenly emanation floats atop everything and looks below, not with disdain but indifference and pity.  Climbing with ferocious effort and unflinching rage, millions and millions of demons rush up to climb to the top just to reach the being above the mountains. When the first demon arrives, the being waves his hand and obliterates the fiend leaving nothing behind, not even its corrupt soul. Then he looks down once more, acknowledging the legions of demons bearing upon him. He closes his eyes and conjures a white blade with black streaks within it, created out of condensed stars and black holes. Once his hand touches the blade's handle, he sighs and sweeps it, cutting the two mountains in half along with every demon that rushed towards him. 

The first solar is the pinnacle of divinity and both the eldest sibling and creator of the other solars. Others ask if this is true or not but there is no sureness, as the divine solar does not deign to answer the question of anyone brave enough to ask him. There is also no sureness as to why Xephalam assumes to be the eldest sibling of the solars, despite his role in their creation.  

Called to be the pinnacle of divinity, Xephalam's appearance is not congruent with his title or the rumors surrounding him. Unlike his other siblings, Xephalam has 6 wings behind his back and each one is made out of pulsating darkness with small golden stars dotted all over them. He wears a dark puple cloak that covers his whole body but it is designed to accomodate his 6 wings. 

Xephalam's siblings are very proactive when it comes to acting upon the many evils of the multiverse but this all pales in comparison to the amount of actions Xephalam has done to prevent evil from overruning the multiverse. While personally inactive in the battle against evil, Xephalam is the hidden master and founder of many powerful organizations that actively root out evil where it may be and his most powerful army, the ascended is currently battling the denizens of the abyss, slowly taking layers one by one. Xephalam has also created many powerful avatars, each one self thinking and sentient that further pushes his agenda.

Despite his actions, he does not personally go in the field to battle the forces of evil even though he is the quite possibly the most powerful source of divine energy in the multiverse. Nobody knows why he does not enter the field but himself. 

Xephalam's army of evil destroying beings are many and only a few of them achieve enough merit to be formally recognized. Within his army, there is a hierarchy formed both by strength and intelligence. Those that fight valiantly in the field and properly coordinate with their allies are rewarded with power and rank but accompanying those are heavier responsibilities. At the top of this hierarchy are 4 beings called the Ascendant Lords. The Ascendant Lords gain powerful gifts directly from Xephalam himself and there are times when an Ascendant Lord can almost be on par with a Solar.

A famous example of the ascendant lords is Phryix herself. Within his own realm, Xephalam is considered to be a peaceful and omniscient sage who is capable of handing out knowledge and information to those fortunate enough to enter it. Despite his non interference policy, Xephalam has a habit of creating powerful items and artifacts and then simply leaving them in the material world. While this may seem careless, Xephalam's plans run long and wide. Eventually these items will fall into the right hands which will either save a small village or the whole world.  

Xephalam's closest friends are his siblings, a few select deities and a miniscule amount of mortals. Among the solars, Magnus is the closest to Xephalam along with his little sister Rundelia. These two spent the most time with him during their juvenile years. Among the many deities in the multiverse, Bahamut is undoubtedly Xephalam's closest ally and the only one he gives the proper respect. The mortals Xephalam remember is below ten fingers but a few notable ones is Crielle Pelaios and Maldine Moonleaf.  

While never truly entering combat, there are times where the King of the Heavens has to heft his blade and slay his enemies. Xephalam's power affords him a relatively peaceful life because there aren't many beings that can challenge him but when it does come to a fight, only supremely powerful deities, elder evils and the oldest primordials can truly challenge him.

While there are many gods who crave this level of power, Xephalam believes it to be both his curse and fate. Burdened with the responsibility as the ultimate caretaker of the multiverse, Xephalam toils endlessly so that he could allow the continued existence of the multiverse. 

When in combat, Xephalam tends to underestimate his opponents due to his massively unfathomable power. Unless he deems his opponent worthy of his power, Xephalam will not use his blade and will engage combat by simply projecting beams of energy or throwing his enemies away using psychokinetic force. His natural ability to create powerful nigh unbreakable forcefields allow him the freedom to act aloof and uninterested in combat. Xephalam naturally treats all forms of combat like a waste of time. 

But it doesn't mean that Xephalam is not serious or capable of treating his opponents seriously. Despite his attitude, he properly surveys the situation and starts to make a list of priorities. If an opponent is a top priority he will destroy them but will keep his bored attitude. If an opponent is capable of breaking his shield, Xephalam will start to treat his opponent more seriously and will summon his blade, the Primordial Divinity. This usually means the complete death and annihilation of his opponent. 

### Xephalam's Field of Judgement
Xephalam will never truly use his field but at the end of this multiverse's cycle, Xephalam will finally release his true form and end all of reality, resetting everything from the beginning. When Xephalam activiates his field, all of reality is affected. No plane or dimension is exempt from this effect. There has no time where Xephalam has failed in his mission of destroying reality when at this state. He would never do this unless the multiverse is too much out of balance. The first solar was originally titled the balancer before being called the "King of Heavens" and before that, he was called the destroyer. 

The role model that his siblings follow, Xephalam's true form is unlike the other solars. When Xephalam activates his field, he transforms into his true form. 

> ##### Xephalam "The Destroyer" 
> If Xephalam uses his field and transforms, he wins. Yes you read that right, Xephalam in his true form allows him to win. IN EVERYTHING. It's stupid and ridiculous at this point. In fact, his current statblock is already BS. If your players can somehow defeat Xephalam, I'd be genuinely surprised. Well either way, despite my guts saying I shouldn't, I promised a statblock. Good luck.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties). Xephalam can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Xephalam wills the force of destruction towards an area of 50 foot radius sphere, within the same plane of existence where he currently is. Any creature, object or item that is in that area must succeed on a DC 30 Charisma saving throw or be disintegrated. This effect manifests as the affected creatures turns to dust. Artifacts and powerful beings (such as gods and primordials) make the saving throw with advantage. If Xephalam uses this lair action, he can instead concentrate on it doubling the size for every round he uses this lair action to concentrate on this ability. He can use this effect even if he used it from the past round. 
- Xephalam conjures a creature with a challenge rating of 30 or below. It acts after his initiative and lasts until it dies or Xephalam dismisses it. 
- Xephalam creates an effect similar to *wish* but all its effects are now virtually limitless but it does not have the ability to destroy or get rid of any creature. Xephalam is not affected by any negative effects of the spell *wish*. 

\pagebreakNum

## Regional Effects
The multiverse which contains the field of judgement by Xephalam is warped by the innate nature of reality, which creates all of the following effects:
- Non magical objects and mundane landscape start to turn to dust. This effect is slow and would take a few years for everything to fully get disintegrated into nothing. Wish can halt this effect for 1 month. 
- All celestials, even the ones that serve another deity, feel the compulsion to go and find Xephalam to either serve him or fight against him.
- All manner of beings will feel the ripple in reality as the destroyer is slowly destroying everything. Aberrations, Fiends and similar beings are willing to put everything aside to try and stop Xephalam's advance. 

### Infinite Soul
When the destroyer and the creator existed in the void, their ensuing battle caused the creator to die but due to the nature of the two supreme beings, the creator was effectively immortal and undying, it only went into a comatose like state. After its death to finally create the multiverse in all its glory, the destroyer fused itself with the soul of the creator, resulting into the balancer who later took the name Xephalam. 

Even then, the creator still continued to exist in many forms. The creator had 4 eyes and each one was said to contain a portion of its infinite and undying soul. The creator never considered Xephalam to be evil and it believed that the other times that Xephalam destroyed the multiverse was both just and correct. Some versions of the multiverse are just too broken to repair. 

But it did believe that some of those destroyed multiverses deserved a chance and due to this, it allowed its 4 eyes to travel around the multiverse, gifting them to potential beings that would be able to convince Xephalam to give their home a second chance. Only a creature who is at the level of a supreme god, supreme primordial or an individual that owns an infinite soul has a chance of standing up against the destroyer, Xephalam. 

Xephalam tends to be very strict with his standards and once he decides to destroy a multiverse, he will only agree to change his decision if and only if the 4 beings gifted with the 4 infinite souls appear to stop him and lead the multiverse to a better state. If there is a missing one, Xephalam will proceed to destroy the 3 other owners of the infinite soul and reset the multiverse from scratch. After the resulting destruction, the 4 souls will find another 4 beings to inherit their power. 

Should a creature that has an infinite soul die, which is considered impossible due to their infinite potential, their soul temporary lingers so that another could take it but should the soul not find any owner, it will leave to find another being worthy of its power. 

#### Infinite Soul
*Wondrous item (soul), artifact (requires attunement)*

You are blessed by the infinite and true creator, you are given the chance to either change the fate of destiny or die along with it. The Infinite soul will only choose a worthy creature and it does not care if the creature is evil or good, as long as it is worthy enough to handle the responsibility to change and wield fate. 

When attuned to the Infinite Soul, you can choose one of your ability scores and it is now 30 while all your other stats become 20. If your chosen stat is already 30, there is no effect and if your other scores are 20 or above, there is not effect. In addition, you gain the following bonuses:

***Infinite Nature.*** Your power is not something mortal creatures or even the greater outerplanar creatures can easily understand. You are immune to all forms of damage from CR 20 creatures and below and resistant to all forms of damage from CR 30 creatures and below. You also gain a damage threshold of 100. You do not tire, hunger or require sleep. You become immune to exhaustion and do not age. You also cannot be aged magically and are effectively immortal but you can still die by unnatural means. 

***Power of Creation.*** Innate to this soul and to the creator is the gift and power of creation without limitations but unfortunately, the quartered soul could not manifest the same power the creator could. It could not even manifest creation at a 1% portion of the creator. 

- ***Creation from Nothing.*** Your soul temporarily warps reality. Unfortunately, the quartered soul is limited in its power and can only use this ability once per day. This effect is similar to the spell *wish* with the following effects. You can use this ability 1 time which recharges daily at dawn.
    - You can create one object of up to 100,000 gp in value that is not a magical item or create one object of up to 10,000 in value that is magical. The object can be no more than 10,000 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see.
    - You allow up to one hundred creatures that you can see to regain all their hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the *greater restoration* and *remove curse* spell.
    - You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to 1 damage type you choose.
    - You grants to one creature you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect forever. You can only grant one form of immunity to a creature, granting a new immunity removes the previous form of immunity.
    - You can cast any 9th level spell or below without any material components. If it deals damage, it deals maximum damage.
    - You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples but it is entirely up to the DM. 

- ***Creation of Landscape.*** Your soul's power cannot actively destroy anything due to its nature but it still has the ability to manipulate reality and thus create powerful and dangerous effects. As an action, you make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and feel like some other sort of terrain. The change is only temporary and only lasts for as long as you concentrate on it (similar to concentrating to a spell) but everything is as you will and imagine. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The change includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any environmental change that would damage a creature can only deal up to 35 (10d6) damage per round to it and the maximum AC and hit points of the matter that you enforce to be tougher is 30 AC and 200 hit points per 100-foot cube. At the start of your turn you can change one physical property of matter in a 100-foot cube centered on a point you can see. This effect can not change magical properties of objects or terrains but can still change their physical ones. These changes to the terrain are permanent until dispelled by a 11th level dispel magic, wish or similar magic. You are immune to the effects of the changed landscape. 

- ***Creation of Life.*** Your soul belongs to the creator who had the power to spawn life by simply thinking it to reality. You have the ability to do something similar to it. As an action, you can conjure any creature of your choice, calling forth as many of them as long as you can divide 1000 hit points among them, each creature having average hit points (see the Monster Manual for statistics). The creatures magically appear in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into a black void and disappear. Once you use this property of the soul, you can't use it again until the next dawn. You cannot conjure specific creatures and can only summon the average of a specific species (e.g. you cannot conjure Acererak but can conjure a normal average lich).

## Xephalam "The Destroyer"
##### "Why are you here? What are you looking for? A satisfying ending? A world where you get what you want? - Xephalam" 

When there was nothing and the multiverse was an non-existent thought, there were first two beings. The creator and the destroyer. At this point in the multiverse, the concepts of good, bad, law or order were non-existent. There were only two concepts. 

Creation and Destruction.

At the beginning, these two did what their nature entailed. The creator tried to create but the destroyer destroyed thus making an endless cycle between the two omnipotent beings. At first they were satisfied and they even made patterns where, the creator would create and the destroyer would hold off destroying it to satisfy the creator's wishes. Once the creator got bored, the destroyer who held off gratification destroys it once more, satisfying the both of them. 

But the two knew that they were more than just this endless cycle. They knew they were the first beings and they both knew that their purpose is far more than just what they are now. They both wished to create something that would last. A grand creation that would satisfy the creator and a grand destruction that would satisfy the destroyer. But what the two supreme beings didn't know was to satisfy their wishes, they must offer a sacrifice to receive such a grand wish. It would include the death of the creator. Before birth, one must first experience destruction.

The concept of sacrifice was alien to these two beings because for them, omnipotence was normal. They asked themselves, would they die? Or would they exist throughout the grand event they planned for themselves. It was at this moment, their first fears manifested but due to their nature, their fear was completely alien in nature and in turn gave birth to the far realms. 

Despite that, they quelled their fears and went through the plan. The destroyer manifested the first weapon in the multiverse, his own personal blade which he used to stab the creator in its metaphorical heart. The creator who was equally omnipotent would not die so easily so to make sure that it dies, it rips apart a large portion of its soul and gives it to the destroyer to make it stronger.

Now imbued with more power, the destroyer slays the creator, spilling its essence all over the multiverse. The body of the creator fell to the ground as it lay the foundation for the multiverse. Its metaphorical organs and body parts then became the many planes of the multiverse. The blood of the creator gave birth to the primordials, beings of pure raw energy, similar to the creator itself. 

The destroyer who was ecstatic that their plan was a success, started to hide itself to allow the multiverse grow. But it made sure that the multiverse had some variety, so it gave the creator's essence a few mixes of his own, creating a new brand of beings called the gods. Different from the primordials, the gods are creation with direction while the primordials themselves are just pure energy. 

The first primordials and gods were aptly called the supreme ones, as they directly came from the two omnipotent beings. At first, it was a peaceful world but the two species started to develop their own way of thinking. Since most of the essence that make up their existence came from the creator, they all wished to create. 

And they did.

The supreme primordials split their bodies into many parts, creating weaker primordials, the ones that mortals and present beings interact with. The deities who had mixed essences, had the ability to procreate thus creating the new generation of true gods, the ones that are most influential in present time. Since the new generation of primordials and deities were not born under the influence of the destroyer, they believed that they were the true rulers of the multiverse and this is where the first wars started.

Despite the horror stories and scary myths that surround the primordials, the ones who started the war were the gods. The new primordials were massively stronger than the new gods, something the supreme deities did not anticipate thus creating a very tense situation where one group is superior to the other. The reason for this is because of the way they were created. The gods had the potential to create an infinite amount of deities due to their ability to procreate while the primordials who did not have the ability to procreate, could only create more primordials by taking it from their own source of power, which replenished itself but took an extremely long time.  

Fortunately for the supreme primordials, their source of power was nigh infinite, only matched by the supreme deities and eclipsed by the creator and destroyer. 

While the gods believed they would eventually defeat the primordials due to their ability to procreate, they feared two things. They feared an attack from the primordials and they didn't want to share the multiverse with the many gods that are being born. This selfishness and free will was born from the mix of the creator and destroyer's essence. It's not to say the primordials lacked these two attributes, but they were too consumed by the idea of creating their own worlds, so they did not act upon these borderline evil thoughts.

It was at this time, that many concepts started to appear. Good, Evil, Order, Chaos and many more, these were the many concepts that appeared from the combined thinking of the primordials and deities. These concepts took physical form and added to the already dangerous environment. 

Outside the multiverse, even farther than the far realms, the destroyer was currently in a dilemma. The destroyer watched the creation of the multiverse and went away to let it grow but made many secret entrances to try and guide their creation. But as time passed, the destroyer found that within his soul and mind were miniscule changes that was growing over time.

The creator's soul that was fused into him was becoming something more than just a power boost. The destroyer and the creator's essence was mixing to form something completely new. This was where the aspect of balance came to be. Within every creation, there must be destruction and from destruction there is creation. This is the result of the two supreme beings fusing into one. In the end, the destroyer's mentality shifted into that of the balancer who understood that there is a need for both. 

The multiverse will have a beginning and end and will have a time of nothingness but it will return to start at the beginning once more. This is the will of the supreme equilibrium. 

The destroyer, now the balancer, appeared once more in its multiverse, only to find a war. The first war, the war between the primordials and deities have started. At the forefront of the primordials was Ahat-Hir, the strongest of all the supreme primordials and at the frontlines of the deities was Io, the supreme all-father of dragons who was at the time, the strongest of all the supreme gods. Their war was fought with thousands of expendable deities and extremely powerful primordials.  

The balancer who was considered to be omnipotent, peered into the crevices of the war and realized who were the ones who started it. The gods started the war, with a few main conspirators. These beings are very familiar to the present time. The first one was called Ahriman, the most lawful but tyrannical of the deities. He was not a supreme deity but was far more intelligent than most of his peers. Conspiring with his plan, was another being. A concept incarnate, it was called the supreme evil who influenced a lot of the deities who were easier to manipulate compared to the primordials. 

The first actual emotion of the balancer was anger but it was with temperance. The balancer summoned its blade once more, to finally end the war. The balancer then cleave the multiverse in equal halves, creating two parallel multiverses that exist at the same time, one for the primordials and one for the gods. This didn't mean they were forever separated, they could still go to the other multiverse but it simply meant, the two powerful species had their own space where they could create. 

To ensure that some form of connection stays between the primordials and deities, the balancer created a gate that connects the two multiverses. The balancer didn't stop there, it then looked for the beings responsible for starting the war. It met the supreme evil and it tried to resist, calling upon all the evils in the multiverse to fuel it's power. The balancer then split it in 7 separate beings, who came to represent the 7 deadly sins. 

Ahriman did not escape punishment as the balancer appeared before him. Not wanting to kill any of his creations without giving them a second chance, the balancer simply punished Ahriman in a way that would haunt him forever. The balancer took hold of Ahriman's essence and split the great evil in two separate beings. One of order and one of chaos. The deity who's intelligence and power was nearly unrivaled was split into two lesser beings. 

The split Ahriman resulted in the chaotic Demogorgon, the first demon and the lawful Asmodeus, the first devil. After their split, Demogorgon and Asmodeus were both thrown into different planes so that they could be left alone without anyone to harm or hurt. 

\pagebreakNum

Once done dealing with the masterminds of the war, the balancer then split the two multiverses once more, creating the upper realms and lower realms, separating the evil deities and primordials to the good deities and primordials.

When the war ended and the evil and good deities and primordials had their own space to create, peace was finally achieved and the balancer stopped interfering. Despite that, it knew that this peace was only temporary. The evil beings that lived in the lower realms would eventually stop their creation and look past to conquer other worlds.

To counter this, the balancer then created powerful beings of supreme origin. These supreme beings are the solar spirits, the first of their kind. He created a total of 23 solar spirits, each one capable of matching the powerful deities and primordials. These 23 spirits were meant to enforce balance in the multiverse but, the balancer did not want them to be robotic creatures for these 23 were its first actual creation and not an aftereffect of the creator's death. 

Infusing them with free will and an inherent nature to protect the multiverse, the solar spirits took physical form, becoming the first true celestials of the multiverse. The solars who were like children started to explore the young multiverse, learning a lot of knowledge and creating their own power. 

It was at this time, the balancer took a different name, as the leader of the Solars and the eventual destroyer and creator of the multiverse, he took the name Xephalam. 

The multiverse continued to evolve as the first demon and devil started to corrupt the lower realms, creating both the Abyss and Hell from their influence. The deities then created the mortals, beings that could give concentrated power through belief and faith, something that Xephalam did not approve of.

The thought of creating a creature for the sole purpose of serving one's selfish needs is disgusting for him. But he did not stop the gods for he saw the mortals and found something both interesting and amazing. These weak and young beings had potential to become just like the ones who created them. Even some of the solars started to fall in love with the concept of mortals and actively helped them. Despite knowing their reponsibilities in the multiverse as the ultimate balancers, they were not informed of Xephalam's true nature.

The environment of the multiverse continued to become more tense as the old deities have fallen due to plots and fights while the primordials slowly became inert as they underwent a hibernation like period. The remaining supreme deities and primordials all disappeared to hide, only to resurface when something is interesting enough for them to appear.

The new gods and new primordials no longer remember the origin of their home and only see the solars as insanely powerful and annoying beings that keep interfering in the actions of others, not realizing how important they are in the cosmic scale.

Now the multiverse is once more at the brink of another cosmic war. The blood war between the chaotic side and the lawful side of Ahriman has been heating up as the first demon and first devil continue to war with each other to slay the other one and regain their true power but with their minds intact. 

The elder evils that were born in the far realm are starting to notice the multiverse more and the supreme primordials and deities are starting to wake from their deep slumber. Celestials of great power have been taking sides and have been inflicting powerful casualties on both sides. The powerful concepts, the 7 deadly sins and their counterpart the 7 heavenly virtues have started to act with their own personal goals fueling their power. 

With the multiverse at the brink of utter destruction, Xephalam has decided it is finally time for the first reset where he will destroy the multiverse and rebuild it from scratch. The most powerful beings of the multiverse that are aware of Xephalam and what he is are now acting to gain enough power, so that they can survive the following cataclysm. 

Unfortunately for everyone, none will survive Xephalam. The survival of the multiverse rests entirely on Xephalam's choices and if the ones that live in it can convince him otherwise.

In the end, even the most powerful of beings will have to fall when the end comes. 

\columnbreak

### End of the Multiverse

At the end of everything, When Xephalam is now actively trying to reset the universe, there is nothing left to do except wait. But for the extremely powerful and strong-willed, there might be a small chance to prevent this. The following conditions will make Xephalam momentarily reconsider his will to destroy the multiverse. 

- If all 4 infinite souls are collected and appear in front of Xephalam, he will reconsider destroying the multiverse. Lacking even a single infinite soul will make Xephalam ignore the owners of the infinite soul and destroy them as per his original plan. 
- Dealing 5000 points of damage towards Xephalam will make him reconsider his actions, believing that with such power, the multiverse might be salvageable. 

- If a group garners the support of the supreme deities, supreme primordials, 7 deadly sins and 7 heavenly virtues, Asmodeus and Demogorgon, Xephalam might reconsider his actions, impressed that the most powerful beings of the multiverse are willing to put aside their differences for the safety of the multiverse. 

- A weapon forged by the creator itself from an infinite soul can temporarily banish Xephalam for 100 years if it hits him with a critical hit. The weapon disintegrates into dust and the infinite soul relocates elsewhere. Xephalam will return slightly annoyed but will continue his original plan. The next time a weapon forged by the creator hits him with a critical hit, Xephalam is only banished for 50 years which is halved consecutively for every time Xephalam is banished, until it reaches a minimum of 1 year. If Xephalam is banished a second time, he will immediately attempt to destroy the one who is currently attuned or owns the a weapon forged by the creator. If the one attuned to the weapon surrenders, Xephalam destroys the weapon instead and leaves the owner alone.  

- If the creator is somehow able to take up physical form and willingly talks Xephalam out of destroying the multiverse, Xephalam will agree due to his connection to the creator. The creator cannot do this without repurcussions due to its irreparable body and quartered soul. The creator might also have to borrow a body which will undoubtedly shatter the body and disintegrate the soul unless it is removed from the body. 

- The strongest artifact in existence, excluding items from the creator and Xephalam, is called Perfection, an item created from the combined essence of the 7 deadly sins and heavenly virtues. Perfection is meant to be the pinnacle of all life. A weapon this powerful functions the same way as a weapon made by the creator. It could temporarily banish Xephalam but unlike a weapon made by the creator, it will not disintegrate and will continue to exist. The banishment's time doesn't get reduced either. Xephalam seems to get annoyed by this artifact because it is the false advertisement of something unattainable by any simple being. The only beings Xephalam considers to be perfect are the original creator and destroyer. Xephalam will destroy Perfection but until the multiverse itself is destroyed, the 7 deadly sins and 7 heavenly virtues will simply reform due to them being original concepts, giving Perfection the chance to be recreated. Xephalam can destroy the concepts permanently but that will lead to a multiverse devoid of all sins and virtues making it a dead multiverse, which is not something he wants. 

> ##### End Results
>
> These are the many ways to convince or temporarily stop Xephalam from destroying everything. But it won't be so easy. If your players manage to reach one of the possible ways to convince Xephalam, it won't just end with him reverting to his base form and leaving everything freely. The world will still crumble with him still staying in his true form. The players will be given a task by Xephalam, a task so hard and grueling it might as well be better for them to let the multiverse be destroyed. The struggle will be similar to entering the far realm and defeating Pandoryn or something of the same level. Once they succeed, reward them by saying that they feel light, as if a heavy burden has been removed from them.

# Appendix A: Optional Rules for the Solars

## The Dungeon Master's Guide
##### "Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men. - Xephalam"

Within this chapter of the compendium is an amount of rules and guidelines that can be applied when using my solars. Remember that you can use my solars in any way you wish and none of them are beholden to these rules. 

### Apotheosized Mind
Solars are immune to any form of psychic damage and if a creature forcefully connects their mind to the solar, they must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against the solar's innate spellcasting DC. On a failed save, the effect is reflected back at the creature.

### Avatars, Aspects and Mortal Forms
**"You killed me? I don't recall ever dying to a weakling like you. You must've killed one of my jury members. If that's the case, you're under arrest. - Iurstina while dodging a greatsword"**  

Solars are beings of extreme power and while they are definitely one of the strongest beings in the multiverse, they are only singular beings. To offset this, Solars have taken the habit of creating and manifesting aspects, avatars and even taking mortal forms. Each solar form will be detailed later on the compendium.

##### Levels of Solar Forms

| Form | Challenge Rating |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Mortal | CR - 20 |
| Aspect | CR - 20 |
| Avatar | CR - 15 |

### Blaze of Glory
**"Solars are sources of infinite energy and even when near death, they can still showcase awe-inspiring power. - Ciaran Goodfellow"**

When a Solar reaches 0 hit points they do not immediately die and can enter Blaze of Glory. During Blaze of Glory, any negative effect affecting them is immediately removed and they can immediately take their turn even if the initiative says otherwise. During this turn, all of the solar's attacks deal maximized damage, they double their movement speed, they're crits quadruple their damage instead of being doubled, they become immune to condition effects and they cannot heal themselves. After Blaze of Glory, unless they've been healed by another source, they turn to dust and discorporate.

### Blessing of the Solar
**"Life is not always easy to live, but the opportunity to do so is a blessing beyond comprehension. In the process of living, we will face struggles, many of which will cause us to suffer and to experience pain. - Crielle Pelaios"**

The natural presence of the solar is extremely powerful and this power bleeds out towards mundane creatures and mundane objects. These effects are purely up to the DM but below are a few examples that come to mind.

- If a solar is keeping a mundane or non magical object near its presence for at least 24 days, it becomes magical. The extent of the magical strength of the item is based on how long the solar is near it. This ability affects any object from common iron daggers to large battleships. 

##### Magical Item Table
| Time Needed | Item Rarity |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 24 Days | Uncommon |
| 24 Weeks | Rare |
| 24 Months | Very Rare |
| 24 Years | Legendary  |
| 24 Millenniums | Artifact |

- If a solar stays relatively close to a mortal for a consistent amount of time, they unconsciously imbue them with power. This boost is permanent and does not stack with the blessing of other solars. In addition, if a solar notices the power they imbued to an individual, they can choose to remove that power.

##### Imbued Power
| Time Needed | Level of Power |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 24 Days | The creature becomes immune towards non magical and mundane diseases. |
| 24 Weeks | Regeneration of 5 hit points per round. |
| 24 Months | Aging halts and the individual is effectively immortal.  |
| 24 Years | Individual gains the celestial creature type with all its base abilities and learns all languages. If the creature cannot speak, they gain the ability to speak. |
| 24 Centuries | Individual gains the abilities and stats of a Planetar but keeps their higher stats and other abilities. |

### Blessed Touch
**"Begone fiend! You have no place here. - Arrid."**

The very touch of a solar is considered holier than the waters in Mount Celestia and the antithesis of all undead and fiends. A solar can choose to touch a creature, object or location and bless or curse it with its essence. This ability to bless and curse has different effects on different things the Solar blesses. Non Undead and Fied creatures gain temporary bonuses, objects gain magical powers and locations either become cursed or hallowed. Blessings that last longer tend to be weaker while blessings that are only up for a short amount of time can show large amounts of power. A solar cannot bless an individual more than once within a month or else the essence of the solar destroys the mortal's body permanently reducing their CON by 1d6 + 2 that cannot be regained except for a wish spell. Spells that have the same effect cannot stack with these blessings unless specified. The effects of a solar's blessing is purely up to the DM but below are a few examples that come to mind.

##### Blessing a Creature
| Duration | Effect Level |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 Day | Once the creature dies, they immediately come back to life with full hit points. They regenerate any wound prior to their blessing and regain any used abilities or class features. |
| 1 Week | Once the creature dies, they immediately come back to life with 1 hit point. They regenerate any wound prior to their blessing but suffer 1d6 - 2 exhaustion. |
| 2 Weeks | Once per day during the duration, whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can choose to roll an additional d20. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. |
| 3 Weeks | A creature can gain the effect of haste once without needing to hold concentration. |
| 1 Month | Their AC when unarmored becomes 15 + dex. |

##### Cursing an Aberration
| Duration | Effect Level |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Indefinite | An aberration cursed by a solar must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against the solar's Innate Spellcasting DC or be true polymorphed into a creature below CR 1. This includes every mortal race and every mortal animal. The aberration can repeat the saving throw at the end of the month. Unless the aberration succeeds, the curse remains. |

\pagebreakNum

##### Cursing a Fiend
| Duration | Effect Level |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Indefinite | A fiend cursed by a solar must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against the solar's Innate Spellcasting DC or be weakened. The weakening can be anything ranging from the temporary or permanent loss of stats to the regressing of their form. The fiend can repeat the saving throw at the end of the month. Unless the fiend succeeds, the curse remains. If the solar does not specify the weakening. The Fiend simply loses 2d10 worth of stats at the start of the month which cannot be regained unless they succeed. The stat loss is entirely up to the DM. |

##### Blessing/Cursing an Undead
| Duration | Effect Level |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Indefinite | An undead blessed by a solar can make a Wisdom saving throw against the solar's Innate Spellcasting DC to resist the effect. Liches roll the saving throw with advantage. The undead's body starts to regenerate and heal itself at a rate of 1 hp at the first day and multiplies by 2 for each following day after. Even if the undead's hit points is maximum, the healing continues despite not adding anymore to the Undead's hit points. Once the stacking hit points reach the undead's maximum hp multiplied by 2, it enters a comatose like state for 1d10 days. After some time, the undead emerges from the comatose like state and returns to its mortal state if it ever had one. An example would be an undead human skeleton returning back into its human form after a given amount of time. In the case that the soul does not want to be resurrected, the body is empty and can be used as a host by any other soul nearby. |
| Indefinite | An undead cursed by a solar must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against the solar's Innate Spellcasting DC or slowly wither to nothing. The withering starts off weak as the Undead loses 1 hp at the first day and multiplies by 2 for each following day after and the target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage dealt. If the undead's maximum hitpoints reach 0, it turns to dust and dies. A lich that dies from this effect retains the curse even if they rejuvenate. The Undead can make a saving throw at the start of the day. |

### Cosmic Force
**"I feel like I live in a multiverse made of paper, always taking constant care not to break something, to break someone. Never allowing myself to lose control even for a moment, or everyone could die. But you can take it, can't you, big man? What we have here is a rare opportunity for me to cut loose and show you just how powerful I really am. - Gaeshema"**

Strength is a subject that all solars have addressed. While strength will not always win you fights, all the solars excel in bringing strength that trumps meteors onto the table. This cosmic force manifests when solars choose to go melee instead of utilizing their massive magical power. When a solar hits a creature with a melee attack, the creature is knocked back by half their strength in feet. If the attack crits, the creature is instead knocked back by twice their strength in feet. If a DM wants to add damage from hitting a hard wall or object, it can be calculated by 1d10 per 10 feet. If a melee attack already has the ability to knock back a creature, the knockback from Cosmic Force is added to the total amount of feet. In addtion, Solars counts as ten times larger in terms of size when determining their carrying capacity and the weight they can push, drag, or lift. If a solar chooses to grapple a creature their size, they make it with advantage. While grappling a creature, as an action, they can choose to throw them towards another creature or object. They can throw them by succeeding a strength check against the creature's strength check. They can throw them a total of thrice their strength in feet. If the creature hits a solid object, they take 1d10 for every 10 feet travelled. If they hit a creature, they both take damage.

### Persistent Presence
**"I could still feel him... It's been a century, yet I can still feel his presence watching over me... - Ounzair talking about Taciax"**

Solars emit an extremely powerful aura that stays even when they're no longer there. While this doesn't have any immediate effects, the essence scattered over the area can be used in a large number of ways. These effects are purely up to the DM but below are a few examples that come to mind.

##### Presence Usage
| Effects | Possible Uses |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Spectral Images of the Solar appearing randomly | This can be used to contact or call upon the solar. |
| Translucent Angel Feathers rarely appear floating | A magical bottle or an item that can collect energy can be used to collect these feathers transforming it into a supreme healing potion. |
| Beautiful orchestras of heavenly music lightly play in the background | This area is considered hallowed and all the effects, including secondary effects, of the hallow spell work. |
| Inhabitants of the area dream of the solar's hidden visage | If a painter was to paint these dreams, the resulting painting is enchanted to be able to seal demons and devils with a CR of 20 or below. The Fiends can resist by succeeding a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. |
| A spectre that doesn't look like the solar warns trespassers that danger is ahead | A successful DC 20 Religion check can allow the PC to properly converse and ask more about the danger ahead. |

### Reality Breaking Visage
**"Look away child. What I am is too much for you and your feeble mind. - Aziraphale. "**

The true form of a solar is said to be the very true form of divinity and the mortal mind cannot comprehend it. Any non-aberration, celestial or fiend must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when in the presence of a solar's true form or enter a comatose like state for 10d10 days. On a success, the creature gains +2 to their Wisdom Ability Score that can't go past the usual limit and become immune to the solar's Reality Breaking Visage. The DC of the saving throw is equal to the solar's innate spellcasting DC.

### Shapeshifting
**"Transformation is an acquired taste—not for the faint of heart. - Clarion"**  

A solar's physical form is purely based on their conscious wants. In truth a solar can take any form they wish but their abilities are still fully theirs. While this ability is not something the solars constantly use, they've been known to take many forms to help many creatures. A prime example was when Arrid took the form of a pure white deer and gave a young wizard help. Eventually the wizard became a powerful champion of good.

The solar magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a Challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any Equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the solar's choice).

In a new form, the solar retains its game Statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, Movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and Special Senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any Statistics and capabilities (except Class Features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

# Appendix B: Player Options

## Gifts of The Solar
##### "Talent is  a gift given by powers greater than you but effort and hardwork is what you give back. - Magnus"

In contrast with the legendary solars and the immortal gods, mortals are extremely short lived. It is common even for a hero to die even before a solar hears of their exploits making them simply letters written in the sand. But every once in a while, a mortal shines so bright that even the solars cannot help but notice them.

These mortals are so bright and so attention grabbing that gods, demon lords, archdevils, creatures from the far realms and even the solars try their best to immediately champion or claim them. When a solar reaches the mortal first, they offer them a pact of power usually called a 'Gift'.

These powerful gifts are usually given to a very exceptional mortal but every once in a while a solar will choose to groom a mortal and give them a gift. A gift grows along the owner. The more accomplished and stronger the owner, the more the gift progresses. 

#### Limitations 

Once a mortal has been given by a solar with a personal gift, they cannot receive or accept other personal gifts from other solars but they can still receive universal gifts. Universal gifts can be given by any solar but personal gifts are their own creation and cannot be replicated by any other solar except Xephalam. Evil characters or characters that go against a Solar's wishes will no longer be able to use their gifts unless permitted.

These gifts can be given by any solar.

# Appendix C: Magical Items
The time spent by solars collecting, creating and destroying magical items is beyond mortal comprehension. While the solars are not worldy creatures, they understand the need to have an arsenal of powerful weapons hidden within their own realms. Detailed in this appendix are the many items the solars have collected over the many milleniums.

## Uncommon Magical Items

#### Blessed eye
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

A small transparent eye that has a milky white color with a golden iris. This eye is a creation of Eridion's genius. Many of his mortal workers and employees happen to deal with eye related accidents because they deal with extremely precise technology so most of them use these eyes.

To use the blessed eye, a creature must gouge out one of their eyes and replace it with the blessed eye. When equipped to the eye, you gain the following bonuses:

**Darkvision.** You gain darkvision up to 60 feet. 

**Magical Capability.** You can cast the spells *detect magic* and *mending* as at will spells.

If you have two blessed eyes in both of your eye sockets, you gain the following bonuses:

**Superior Darkvision.** You gain darkvision up to 120 feet.

**Masterful Memory.** When you see a creation of any non-magical object, the eyes can memorize them giving you proficiency on any check when you are creating or interacting with them.

## Rare Magical Items

#### Angel Slayer
*Weapon (any non-bludgeoning weapon), rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 

When you hit an angel with this weapon, the angel takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's type. For the purpose of this weapon, "angel" refers to any creature with the celestial type, including couatl and empyreans. 

#### Moon Touched Blade
*Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)*

A beautiful longsword with a blade that appears to have a dull purple shimmer. Its handle is made out of wood that has a very dark color giving it an appearance similar to black metal. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This longsword deals an additional 2d8 radiant damage against shapechangers and undead. 

As a bonus action, you can speak the command word of the blade and it starts to emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet around you. Shapechangers that enter the radius of the bright light takes 2d8 radiant damage at the start of their turn while creatures that enter the dim light takes 1d8 radiant damage instead.

> **True Form.** Moon Touched Blades are very close to the Goddess Selune and the Solar Tystra and because of this, with enough effort, these weapons could be transformed to reach their true form. The nature of this release is up the DM and if successful, the blade becomes a lunar blade.

## Very Rare Magical Items

#### Dominion Bottle
*Wondrous item, very rare*

Forged from infernal black metal, the dominion bottles were created by the most powerful lords of the Abyss and the greatest dukes of Hell. Used to trap the blood of a solar, the dominion bottle is able to keep any liquid in the multiverse and keep it in a stasis preventing dilution, spoilage or any similar mishap. 

***Capture Liquid.*** Point the bottle towards any liquid and say its command word. Immediately all the liquid will quickly pour into the bottle up to a maximum of 500 feet cubit volume worth of liquid. 

***Expel Liquid.*** The bottle can expel liquid similar to a *decanter of endless water*.

#### Ring of the Heavens
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to summon a particular deva from the Heavenly Realm of Xephalam. The deva appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane. 

While summoned, the deva is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any good aligned commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the deva defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions. If the deva realizes that you are in fact an evil aligned creature, it will attack you with the intent of destroying the ring to prevent you from summoning it.
After the deva departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the deva dies. 

#### Solar Blood
*Blood, very rare*

Golden and divine in appearance, the blood of a solar is a very rare material that isn't commonly found anywhere. After all, the act of wounding a solar is an event that only happens every few centuries.

The blood of a solar is poisonous to fiends and the mere drop of one could send even the strongest devils and demons fleeing. The blood of a solar is slightly sentient, fully aware of its own power so it makes sure that it tries to dilute itself into a harmless liquid.

The blood of a solar, if not stored in a dominion bottle, will eventually dilute itself into water within 1 minute. 

When stored in a dominion bottle, the blood of a solar can do the following:
- When ingested, the blood acts as a *supreme healing potion*.
- It can return a dead creature you pour the blood onto back to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. The blood closes all mortal wounds, heals all non-magical diseases and regenerates any lost limbs. 
- The blood also acts as a material that prevents fiends from moving. If poured over a fiend, the fiend must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. 
- If the blood is mixed with holy water, it transforms into a holy bomb that as an action, can be used to splash the contents of the bottle onto a creature within 10 feet of the holder or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged Attack against a target creature, treating the solar blood as an Improvised Weapon. If the target is a fiend or Undead, it takes 10d6 radiant damage.

## Legendary Magical Items

#### Muramasa
*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

Hailed as a great demon blade, Muramasa was created by the legendary swordsmith whose name is where the blade was based upon. 

You gain a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this weapon. In addition, when you make an attack with Muramasa, the roll you need to score a critical hit increases by 3. For example, from 19-20 to 16-20.  

***Curse.*** The blade is constantly thirsting for blood and must be sated when unsheathed. When unsheathed, the creature attuned to it suffers 1d10 necrotic damage at the start of their turn. This damage is negated if the creature spends their turn damaging another creature. The creature attuned to the blade cannot easily part with it and will never allow it to be away from their person. Any attempt to unattune from the item forces the creature to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature suffers 4d10 necrotic damage and you fail to unattune to the item. On a successful one, the creature manages to separate itself from the sword. 

Any necrotic damage dealt by the sword ignore resistances and treats immunities as resistances. 

***Clarity within the Bloody Storm.*** While in combat every turn you don't attack, you take damage according to Muramasa's curse. Every time you take damage or get healed from by Muramasa's features, you accumulate a curse die which is represented by a d8, up to a max of 10. You lose all accumulated curse dice once you sheath Muramasa.

When you have a curse die, you can expend it in many ways. 

**- Living Blood (1 Curse Die).**  As an action, you spend 1 Curse dice and regain 1d8 hit points. This does not generate Curse Dice.

**- Dying Blood (1 Curse Die).** As an action, you spend 1 Curse dice and empower Muramasa with willpower. Your next melee weapon attack deals an additional 1d8 Necrotic damage.

**- Coagulated Blood (3 Curse Die).** As an action, you spend 3 Curse die and form a thick viscous armor made of blood around you. Roll 1d8 and add the result to your Armor Class which lasts for 1 minute.

**- Vengeful Blood (3 Curse Die).** As an action, you spend 3 Curse die and empower Muramasa with self consuming hatred. Muramasa deals an additional 2d8 Necrotic damage which lasts for 1 minute. For the duration, you take 2d8 Necrotic damage every time you damage a creature. The damage taken from this property can generate Curse Dice.

**- Purified Blood (5 Curse Die).** As an action, you can spend 5 Curse die and cast the spell *greater restoration* on yourself. 

**- Cursed Blood (5 Curse Die).** As an action, you can spend 5 Curse die and infuse Muramasa with your own curse. The next time you hit a creature, it is affected by the spell *flesh to stone* (Spell DC 17).

**- Immortal Blood (10 Curse Die).** As a reaction, you can spend 10 Cursed die and reduce any incoming damage to 0. 

**- Godslaying Blood (10 Curse Die).** As an action, you can spend 10 Cursed die and allow Muramasa to slay anything with your blood as a catalyst. Your next attack deals an additional 20d8 necrotic damage but you take an equal amount of damage. You cannot heal from the attack with this property. 

***Selfish Strength.*** When your attack is a critical hit, you heal for half the damage dealt. You cannot be healed by being damaged by Muramasa. You cannot be healed by any outside sources such as healing spells and potions but you can still heal yourself using any of your features, a long rest, a short rest or attuned items.

#### Solar Blade
*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

There are times when a Solar will find a Sun Blade within the dark realms they traverse and just like most of them, they will hide it within their massive hidden vaults but every once in a while a solar will encounter a good and struggling mortal in these realms. If the solar finds these mortals worthy enough, they will quickly retrieve the blade and imbue it with their powerful essence then hand it to the mortal as to provide assistance to them in the dark realm. If the mortal fails or dies, the solar returns to retrieve the blade. If the blade is in the hands of a powerful enemy, the solar simply removes the essence imbued in the blade returning it back to its original form.

Just like a Sun Blade, it appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, an attuned creature can use their bonus action to cause a blade of pure divinity to spring out of existence or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the solar blade.

Only good creatures can attune to the solar blade. Any evil creature that try to attune to the  blade must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 radiant damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and turns to dust.

An attuned creature gain a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an Undead or Fiend with it, that target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage. 

The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 60 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. You also gain true sight with a range of 15 feet.

***Radiant Resistance.*** You gain resistance to radiant damage and advantage on any effect that would blind you.

***Sunbeam.*** You can cast the spell *sunbeam* with the blade being the source of the beam (Spell DC 17). Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again for 24 hours.

***Sunburst.*** Once per day, you can hold the blade's hilt with two of your hands and raise it up to the sky casting the spell *sunburst* (Spell DC 17). Once you use this feature, the blade loses all its properties for 24 hours.

***Turn Evil.*** As an action, you raise the solar blade censuring all evil. Each Undead and Fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. 

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

***Bane of Evil.*** Any undead or fiend, with a CR of 2 or below, that is damaged or affected by this blade's turn undead feature immediately dies and is disintegrated.

\pagebreakNum

#### Lunar Blade
*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

The Moon Touched Blade is said to be a part of the many weapons that Selune and Tystra created with their own powers. Similar to the sun blade, the moon touched blade is a weaker form of its true state. This blade has a portion of Selune and Tystra's true essence turning it into a powerful weapon. 

It is a beautiful weapon with a dull purple metal blade that shimmers like the moon with a black handle that have engravings of the moon. Only champions of Selune or Tystra can attune to the lunar blade. Any evil creature that try to attune to the blade must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 radiant damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and turns to dust.

An attuned creature gain a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a Shapechanger or Undead with it, that target takes an extra 4d8 radiant damage.

As a bonus action, you can say the sword's command word allowing it to emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is moonlight but it affects creatures as if it were sunlight. Shapechangers that enter the radius of the bright light takes 4d8 radiant damage at the start of their turn while creatures that enter the dim light takes 2d8 radiant damage instead and they reveal their true form. You also gain true sight with a range of 15 feet.

***Dark side of the Moon.*** You can cast the spell *invisibility* as an at will spell but you can only cast it on yourself.

***Power of the Moon.*** The power of the moon allows you to make powerful attacks fueled by the sword. You have 3 charges and regain 1d4 - 1 (minimum of 1) charges daily at dawn.

- ***High Tide.*** As an action, you can spend 1 charge to teleport up to your speed and immediately attack a creature within range. Once hit, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking the weapon's damage and an additional 14 (4d6) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed saving throw or no damage on a success. 

- ***Low Tide.*** When you are hit by an effect that forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 1 charge to reroll the saving throw with an additional +3 to your saving throw. If you succeed on the saving throw, you gain a +3 to your Armor Class that lasts until the end of your next turn.

- ***Crescent Moon.*** As an action, you can spend 1 or more charges to swing the blade in a crescent style unleashing a powerful wave of destructive energy towards a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) radiant damage on a failed save or no damage on a successful one. You increase the damage by 5d6 for every charge you use above  1 charge.

***Soothing Aura.*** When a humanoid or beast with a CR of 5 or below enters the light, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the start of its turn ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw are immune to the effect for 24 hours.

## Artifacts

#### Corellon's Essence Spear
*Weapon (spear), artifact (requires attunement by a creature with the Fey Ancestry Trait or by a Fey)*

Corellon's Essence Spear is a weapon created by the God of Elves with sole purpose of slaying the God of Orcs Gruumsh. The spear has many forms and all of them shares the following properties. 

The spear is a small object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to twice your hit point maximum. You can use your Wisdom in place of Strength for attack rolls and damage rolls with this weapon and its Dexterity and Strength scores are equal to your Wisdom score unless otherwise specified. If it drops to 0 hit points, it becomes inanimate and functions like a silvered spear until you complete a short or long rest and it can't be destroyed short of a wish spell.

As a Bonus Action on your turn you may change its form, giving it new properties:

- **Form one - Essence Spear.** As an Action you can move the spear up to 60 feet and make two attacks against a creature within 5 feet of the Spear. On a hit the target takes 3d8 + Wisdom Modifier slashing damage. 

- **Form two - Golem.** The spear becomes a Large object (the newly transformed spear appears to transform into a form you choose it to have but it must be humanoid in nature), it has a Strength of 28 (+9) and Dexterity of 10 (+0). As an Action you may move it 40 feet and perform two attacks to a creature within 10 feet of the spear, either of which you can substitute for a grapple (Escape DC 20), or a shove (Pushes 15 feet instead of 5 feet), you use the spear's Strength score for the grapple skill checks. Its attacks deal 4d4 + 9 bludgeoning damage instead of the spear's normal damage dice while in this form.

- **Form three - Stonemaker.** As an Action you can move the spear 60 feet and make a single attack, on a hit the creature takes no damage but must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 7 or more, the creature is instantly Petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is Restrained. The Restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming Petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the Greater Restoration spell or other magic.

- **Form four - Elven Sunlight.** The spear becomes a Large Object (the newly transformed object becomes a unmoving statue of your choice) centered on a point you choose within 20 feet of you. As an Action you can cast the spell *Sunbeam* originating from the spear, you have disadvantage on concentration checks to maintain this spell and you must also make a concentration check to maintain the spell when the spear is attacked.

- **Form five - Hail of Arrows.** The spear becomes a mass of arrows which all share the same hit point pool. As an action you may move the mass 60 feet and attack each creature within 10 feet of it. Each creature within the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d4 piercing damage and be restrained on a failed save, or no damage and not be restrained on a successful one. If the mass of arrows is subjected to an area effect they take double the damage. When changing forms the whole mass coagulate into the new form. 
 
- **Form six - Armored Warrior.** The spear transforms into suitable armor that joins with the user increasing their AC to 22 and their unarmed attacks now use a d12 for their damage dice, the user can use their Wisdom in place of Strength for attack rolls and damage rolls using unarmed strikes. When subjected to any form of damage, you only take half damage while the spear takes the other half.

- **Form seven - Sunlight.** The spear becomes a tiny object that hovers within 5 feet of the user, it gives off bright light up to 120 feet and dim light for an additional 60 feet. The user can control the range of both instances of lighting to a minimum of 5 feet each. This light is considered to be sunlight.

- **Form eight - Blessing of the Elven God.** As an action you can cast the spell Otiluke's Resilient Sphere on an ally using the spear as the material component which vanishes while you concentrate on the spell. While a creature is trapped in the Sphere, you can use a bonus action to reduce the spear's hit points and heal the creature by an equal amount. If the creature is unconscious while inside this spear you can expend an additional 10 hit points to stabilize them.

# Appendix D: Avatars & Aspects 

The solars are a group of far reaching and nigh omnipotent celestials but their number is limited to 24 and no matter how powerful they are, excluding Xephalam, they will not be able to help everyone. At first they created their soldiers to assist them in spreading their influence all over the multiverse but while their numbers were many, they were not as powerful as the solars themselves thus they lacked the heavy impact the solars had. 

Slightly worried about the multiverse, the solars took to their eldest brother's example. They created avatars and aspects that allowed them to spread influence while having a sizeable amount of power with them. The avatars of solars are sentient on their own and can act without their solar's will. If a solar so wishes, they can take full control of an avatar or aspect and act according to their will. 

Since the many avatars of the solars are sentient on their own, their power is directly tied to how much they act to follow the will of their solar. If they act accordingly, the solar will bestow more power upon them but if they do not, they risk losing their power or even worse, get erased from existence. 

Unlike avatars, aspects are not fully sentient but they have the ability to think with some limited freedom. 

##### Ignis Fireprime
When Ragani realized that he was one of the weakest solars out of the 24, albeit one of the most influential, he had decided to not compete for power but instead raise his influence and potential so that he can still assist the multiverse without being lagging behind his relatively more powerful siblings. 

While every solar has many avatars, Ragani's most famous and known avatar is Ignis Fireprime. A humanoid figure with black as coal skin and eyes that shine like lava, Ignis is the most prolific and powerful of Ragani's avatars. 

Rough in attitude but firm in decisions, Ignis is a very serious individual that cares for Ragani's plans of protecting the world from the many dangers that can possibly destroy it. Despite his power, Ignis is still weaker than the solar by a large margin and because of this, he has made allies with other powerful adventurers when an enemy is too strong for him alone. His rough attitude but endearing kindness radiates a large gap where people can fit themselves. After a while, even the toughest adventurers will learn how to share drinks with this dark-skinned celestial.

##### Fotiá
An aspect of Ragani and unlike the fully sentient avatar, Fotiá is similar to a machine that travels the multiverse, commanding Ragani's soldiers and serving his cause. Orange skin, lava-like hair and black eyes, Fotiá is the most commanding of all Ragani's aspects. 

This aspect embodies the most extreme of Ragani's nature. Fotiá is very straightforward and down to the letter but will also not hesitate in burning any heretics or enemies it can see. In truth, if not for the limited power Fotiá has, he would act very similar to his master, Ragani.

##### Nar

Ragani has many aspects but there is one that he considers to be his favorite. When Ragani travels, there is one aspect that he purposely created to follow him and act as both as a messenger for him should he be too busy to deal with it himself. Nar, is the weakest of Ragani's aspects but undoubtedly the fastest. Nar appears to be a small humanoid that resembles a child with 4 fiery wings behind him. Nar is not a very strong combatant, in fact Ragani barely put any offensive abilities in the aspect, excluding its defensive abilities. Despite that, Nar is usually capable of sending all of Ragani's messages. Should the weak aspect die, its essence will immediately return to Ragani and he will be aware of who or what killed it. And a fair warning to others, Ragani treasures the young aspect and will take vengeance on the one who killed it.

##### Merrick Heaveneyes

Within the kindness of Arrid and the natural stern attitude of the solars, Merrick Heaveneyes, Arrid's most powerful avatar was born. Just as kind as his solar but with the addition of being born with the sole purpose of saving mortals and helping them, Merrick is the prime example of a pure celestial. 

Strong and capable of wiping out all his enemies, never showing fear in the face of adversity and a kind visage that will protect others, Merrick is the greatest pride of Arrid. Despite their similarities, Merrick does not use solely a shield. Unlike his supremely powerful solar, Merrick does not carry the same impact as Arrid does and must make adjustments to his fighting style or else it risks him losing battles he could win. 

When Arrid created Merrick, he had an idea in mind. He wanted to fuse the best of both worlds. The great power and reach of the solars and the infinite potential of mortals and their ability to push through their limits no matter what. Unlike the other avatars, Merrick is a mortal that needs to sleep, eat and rest. He gets tired like any other mortal but unlike any other mortal, Merrick is capable of divine feats that would shock even the most powerful of angels. 

Due to this weird hybrid nature, Merrick has proven to reach and sometimes surpass Arrid's expectations. His mortality makes him more prone to making relationships with other mortal creatures. Adventurers and even peasants, Merrick has made friends with many all the while saving those that needs saving. Merrick is also one of the few solar avatars who has actually fought a god, a feat usually reserved to the solars themselves.

##### Bonum

The solars aren't required to create aspects but Arrid felt that he needed someone to lead his soldiers, especially since Arrid spends most of his time in mortal worlds with Phryix. This feeling of responsibility lead to the creation of Bonum, an aspect that carries Arrid's will throught the multiverse when leading his soldiers. Golden hair, glowing white eyes and flawless skin, Bonum is the aspect of Arrid that is capable of a stern but kind command.

This aspect embodies Arrid's wish to help the multiverse on a bigger scale. He is compassionate and patient to all but he is not naive or stupid. He will not hesitate to unleash the power of the kind solar against all inherently evil creatures.

##### Genia

Bonum's assistant and Arrid's secretary, Genia is a relatively weak aspect of Arrid that is made specifically for their convenience. Genia takes delight in helping her superiors as she appears to be a young female wearing light but professional clothes. When mortals see her, they immediately think of 'help' or 'assistant' but just like her fellow aspects, Genia carries a portion of Arrid's power making her a dangerous enemy.

Genia takes notes and lists down all the tasks of Arrid and Bonum and does her best to assist them in any way possible, even when it means that she'll have to enter danger. While not powerful alone, Genia is usually protected by the powerful soldiers of Arrid.
