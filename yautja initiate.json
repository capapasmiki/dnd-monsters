On a failed saving throw, the smart disc cuts off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off this with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes 27 ({@damage 6d8}) slashing damage from the hit. The smart disc returns to the yautja after it is thrown."
